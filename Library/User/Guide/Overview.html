<H1>W3C Library Interfaces</H1>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/construction.gif"> Any suggestions or ideas are welcome at <A
HREF="mailto:libwww@w3.org">libwww@w3.org</A>. <P>

This is the overall set of interfaces in the W3C Reference Library. An interface can cover multiple
related C modules and it is defined by a <B>WWW*.h</B> include file, for example <A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWCore.html">WWWCore.h</A>. On <A HREF="../Platform/WinDLL.html">Windows
platforms</A>, each interface corresponds to a DLL with a DLL definition file defining all exported
methods and data objects. You can also have a look at the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/windows/wwwlist.txt">complete list of all public functions</A>.<P>

Every module in the Library has a HTML document associated with it containing a detailed description
of the functionality and interface to other modules. This page is the top node for the
implementation specific documentation and contains links to all the modules in the Library.  The
documentation is dynamically kept up to date as the actual include files (.h) are generated from the
HTML documents using the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>. <P>

When compiling the Library please make sure that you have a relatively new version of the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> that parses the HTML documents correctly (2.13 and
newer versions). Find out what version of the Line Mode Browser you are using by typing

<PRE>
	./www -version
</PRE>

Also remember that when editing the module interfaces or adding functionality then always use the
HTML files and not the .h files! <P>

<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="../../../Icons/32x32/caution.gif" ALT="NOTE"> This document is also available
as <A HREF="choppy.html"><B>one big HTML file</B></A> intended for printout. Please note that not
all links in this version work!<P>

<H2>Core Interfaces</H2>

The core interfaces must be included in all applications.

<A NAME="dll"><H3>Windows Specifics</H3></A>

The wwwdll library is a tiny library that contains a pointer to the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/TTYPrint.html">TTYPrint</A> function. When Windows loads a DLL, the
exported function and data pointers get "fixed up" in the other modules.  Consequently, what may be
a directly addressable piece of data in it's home library will be a pointer in the other libraries
and executables that dynamically link to it. The <A
HREF="../../Implementation/TTYPrint.html">TTYPrint</A> pointer is <A
HREF="../../Implementation/windows/wwwdll.def">exported</A> to the other modules and referenced via
the TTYPrint macro in <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTUtils.html">HTUtils.h</A>. <A
HREF="#dll">wwwdll.dll </A> also contains the WWW_TraceFlag to the same end of macroing the
indirection.

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWUtil.html"><H3>Basic Utilities</H3></A>

The Utility modules are mostly container modules, dynamic strings and other stuff that you can't
live without when building applications. The modules are used by the core part of the W3C Reference
Library but can also be used by the application. See also the main Library include file called <A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> which contains all converters and protocol
modules known to the Library. You can include this one if the application is to use all the
functionality of the Library.

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWCore.html"><H3>Core Interface</H3></A>

This is the basic include file for the core of the W3C Reference Library. Together with the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWUtil.html">WWWUtil module</A> it contains all core specific modules
which are required to compile and build the Library. The core part of the Library is designed as a
set of registration modules with no real functionality in itself. Instead all the functionality
comes when the application registers the modules that provides a desired functionality, for example
accessing HTTP servers or the local file system. The Library has a special include file called <A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A> which a lot of application helper modules that
makes it easier to use the core.

<H2>Stream Interfaces</H2>

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWCache.html"><H3>Persistent Cache</H3></A>

The cache contains details of temporary disk files which contain the contents of remote documents.

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWHTML.html"><H3>HTML Parser and Generator</H3></A>

This is the include file for the basic HTML module that can be used together with the core of the
W3C Reference Library. It contains all HTML specific modules which are required to compile and build
the HTML DLL. Please note that as the <A HREF="../../Implementation/HText.html">HText</A> is
<B>not</B> included in this interface. The reason is that the HText interface only is declared by
the Library but must be defined by the application. Therefore it can not be part of a DLL but must
be included directly in the application.<P>

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWDir.html"><H3>Directory Browsing</H3></A>

This is the include file for the directory handling modules that can
be used together with the core of the W3C Reference Library. It
contains all Directory specific modules which are required to compile
and build the DIRECTORY DLL.<P>

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWGuess.html"><H3>Content Type Guessing Stream</H3></A>

This interface provides functionality for guessing unknown media types from magic words. The stream
is a one that reads first a chunk of stuff, tries to figure out the format, and calls
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This is a kind of lazy-evaluation of
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This could be extended arbitrarily to recognize all the possible file
formats in the world, if someone only had time to do it. <P>

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWMIME.html"><H3>MIME Parser and Generator</H3></A>

This is the module for basic RFC822/MIME parsing that can be used together with the core of the W3C
Reference Library. It contains all MIME specific modules which are required to compile and build the
MIME DLL.<P>

<H2>Application Interfaces</H2>

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWRules.html"><H3>Rule File Management</H3></A>

A way to initialize applications is to use a rule file, also known as a configuration file. This is
for example the case with the W3C httpd and the W3C Line Mode Browser. This module provides basic
support for configuration file management and the application can use this is desired. The module is
not referred to by the Library. Reading a rule file is implemented as a stream converter so that a
rule file can come from anywhere, even across the network! <P>

Applications do not have to provide native support for all protocols, they can in many situations
rely on the support of proxies and gateways to help doing the job. Proxy servers are often used to
carry client requests through a firewall where they can provide services like corporate caching and
other network optimizations. Both Proxy servers and gateways can serve as "protocol translators"
which can convert a request in the main Web protocol, HTTP, to an equivalent request in another
protocol, for example NNTP, FTP, or Gopher. In case a proxy server or a gateway is available to the
application, it can therefore by use of HTTP forward all requests to for example a proxy server
which then handle the communications with the remote server, for example using FTP about the
document and return it to the application (proxy client) using HTTP.

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWApp.html"><H3>Application Specific</H3></A>

This module provides some "make life easier" functions in order to get the application going. They
help you generate the first anchor, also called the <EM>home anchor</EM>. It also contains a nice
set of default WWW addresses.

<H3>Initialization Modules</H3>

The core parts of the Library is a framework for adding functionality. It has hooks for adding
protocol modules, like for example HTTP, FTP, and also for adding streams that can convert from one
media type to some other type, or presenting the result to the user. In the distribution file of the
Library you will find a large set of protocol modules and streams already implemented. However, in
order to use these you need to initialize them. This can be done by using the methods in the <A
HREF="WWWInit.html">WWWInit</A> module. You can modify these modules as you like to fit your
particular needs. The modules in this interface are <B>not</B> part of any DLL and so must be
included directly if desired.
