<H1>Stream Modules</H1>

A <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTStream.html">stream</A> is an object
which accepts sequences of characters. It is a destination of data
which can be thought of much like an output stream in C++ or an ANSI
C-file stream for writing data to a disk or another peripheral
device. The Library defines a generic stream class in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTStream.html">HTStream module</A>, but
almost all stream modules define their own sub class definition of the
stream object.

<H2>Protocol Streams</H2>

These are normally internal streams that parses or generates protocol
specific information to communicate with remote servers.

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTTPReq.html">HTTP Request Stream</A>
<DD>This stream is one of the first real protocol streams - more are to come!
</DL>

<H2>Converters and Presenters</H2>

Streams that can be used to convert data from one media type to
another or create a graphic object and present it to the user. These
are streams that save the data to a local file and then calls an
external program, for example a postscript viewer. These are normally
initialized as a <A HREF="Prefs.html">application preference</A>.

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/SGML.html">SGML Tokenizer</A>
<DD>Parses the data and generates a <A HREF="StrucStreams.html">
structured stream</A>. Each parser instance is created with reference
to a particular DTD structure.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTMLGen.html">Plain to HTML Converter</A>
<DD>This stream takes a plain file and converts it into HTML. Like the
SGML tokenizer, it also converts a generic stream into a structured
stream.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTPlain.html">Plain Text Presentation</A>
<DD>Takes plain ASCII text and presents it to the user as preformatted text.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTMIME.html">HTTP/MIME header parser</A>
<DD>Parse a MIME format message and puts all the information in an <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html">Anchor object</A>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTWSRC.html">WAIS source file Stream</A>
<DD>Parses a <EM>WAIS source</EM> description file. By default, this
is enabled even if direct WAIS access is not present (no linking with
the freeWAIS library).

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTGuess.html">Guessing Stream</A>
<DD>If the input format is unknown at the time when putting up a
stream stack, then this module scans a part of the stream and on a
statistical basis determines the type of stream needed from the <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/">content-type</A>.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTXParse.html">External Parser with Call back</A>
<DD>This is a call back stream module where the implementation is
defined in the application and not in the Library.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">Save Locally</A>
<DD>The <EM>HTSaveLocally</EM> stream saves the data object to a local file.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">Save Locally and Execute Application</A>
<DD>The <EM>HTSaveAndExecute</EM> stream saves the data object to a
local file and calls an external application, for example a post
script viewer.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">Save Locally and Execute Application</A>
<DD>The <EM>HTSaveAndCallBack</EM> stream saves the data object to a
local file, calls an external application and when the stream is
freed, the libwww application gets called with a specified call back
function.

</DL>

<H2>I/O Streams</H2>

Streams that can write data to a socket or an ANSI C FILE object.
This can be used when redirecting a request to a local file of when
saving a document in the cache.

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">ANSI C File Writer stream</A>
<DD>Writes to an ANSI C FILE * object, as opened by fopen, etc.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html#cache">Cache Writer Stream</A>
<DD>This is the stream that's used by the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html#cache">cache manager</A>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTWriter.html">Socket Writer Stream</A>
<DD>Writes to a socket or something opened with the UNIX file I/O open
function.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTNetTxt.html">Net to Text Converter</A>
<DD>Converts "Net ASCII" line terminators <CODE>&lt;CRLF&gt;</CODE>
into the equivalent C representation which is a '\n'.

</DL>

<H2>Basic Streams</H2>

A set of basic utility streams with no or little internal contents
but required in order to cascade streams.

<DL>

<DT><A NAME="z75" HREF="../../Implementation/HTTee.html">Tee Stream</A>
<DD>Just writes into two streams at once. Useful for taking a copy for a cache.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">Black Hole</A>
<DD>A quite expensive way of piping data into a hole for then to be forgotten forever.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">Through Line</A>
<DD>A short circuited stream that returns the same output sink as it is called with.

</DL>
