<H1>W3C Library Interfaces</H1>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/construction.gif"> Any suggestions or ideas are welcome at <A
HREF="mailto:libwww@w3.org">libwww@w3.org</A>. <P>

This is the overall set of interfaces in the W3C Reference Library. An interface can cover multiple
related C modules and it is defined by a <B>WWW*.h</B> include file, for example <A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWCore.html">WWWCore.h</A>. On <A HREF="../Platform/WinDLL.html">Windows
platforms</A>, each interface corresponds to a DLL with a DLL definition file defining all exported
methods and data objects. You can also have a look at the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/windows/wwwlist.txt">complete list of all public functions</A>.<P>

Every module in the Library has a HTML document associated with it containing a detailed description
of the functionality and interface to other modules. This page is the top node for the
implementation specific documentation and contains links to all the modules in the Library.  The
documentation is dynamically kept up to date as the actual include files (.h) are generated from the
HTML documents using the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>. <P>

When compiling the Library please make sure that you have a relatively new version of the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> that parses the HTML documents correctly (2.13 and
newer versions). Find out what version of the Line Mode Browser you are using by typing

<PRE>
	./www -version
</PRE>

Also remember that when editing the module interfaces or adding functionality then always use the
HTML files and not the .h files! <P>

<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="../../../Icons/32x32/caution.gif" ALT="NOTE"> This document is also available
as <A HREF="choppy.html"><B>one big HTML file</B></A> intended for printout. Please note that not
all links in this version work!<P>

<H2>Core Interfaces</H2>

The core interfaces must be included in all applications.

<A NAME="dll"><H3>Windows Specifics</H3></A>

The wwwdll library is a tiny library that contains a pointer to the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/TTYPrint.html">TTYPrint</A> function. When Windows loads a DLL, the
exported function and data pointers get "fixed up" in the other modules.  Consequently, what may be
a directly addressable piece of data in it's home library will be a pointer in the other libraries
and executables that dynamically link to it. The <A
HREF="../../Implementation/TTYPrint.html">TTYPrint</A> pointer is <A
HREF="../../Implementation/windows/wwwdll.def">exported</A> to the other modules and referenced via
the TTYPrint macro in <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTUtils.html">HTUtils.h</A>. <A
HREF="#dll">wwwdll.dll </A> also contains the WWW_TraceFlag to the same end of macroing the
indirection.

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWUtil.html"><H3>Basic Utilities</H3></A>

The Utility modules are mostly container modules, dynamic strings and other stuff that you can't
live without when building applications. The modules are used by the core part of the W3C Reference
Library but can also be used by the application. See also the main Library include file called <A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> which contains all converters and protocol
modules known to the Library. You can include this one if the application is to use all the
functionality of the Library.

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWCore.html"><H3>Core Interface</H3></A>

This is the basic include file for the core of the W3C Reference Library. Together with the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWUtil.html">WWWUtil module</A> it contains all core specific modules
which are required to compile and build the Library. The core part of the Library is designed as a
set of registration modules with no real functionality in itself. Instead all the functionality
comes when the application registers the modules that provides a desired functionality, for example
accessing HTTP servers or the local file system. The Library has a special include file called <A
HREF="../../Implementation/WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A> which a lot of application helper modules that
makes it easier to use the core.

W3C Reference Library. It contains all HTML specific modules which are required to compile and build
the HTML DLL. Please note that as the <A HREF="../../Implementation/HText.html">HText</A> is
<B>not</B> included in this interface. The reason is that the HText interface only is declared by
the Library but must be defined by the application. Therefore it can not be part of a DLL but must

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWGuess.html"><H3>Content Type Guessing Stream</H3></A>

This interface provides functionality for guessing unknown media types from magic words. The stream
is a one that reads first a chunk of stuff, tries to figure out the format, and calls
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This is a kind of lazy-evaluation of
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This could be extended arbitrarily to recognize all the possible file
formats in the world, if someone only had time to do it. <P>

Reference Library. It contains all MIME specific modules which are required to compile and build the
MIME DLL.<P>

<H2>Application Interfaces</H2>

<A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWRules.html"><H3>Rule File Management</H3></A>

A way to initialize applications is to use a rule file, also known as a configuration file. This is
for example the case with the W3C httpd and the W3C Line Mode Browser. This module provides basic
support for configuration file management and the application can use this is desired. The module is
not referred to by the Library. Reading a rule file is implemented as a stream converter so that a
rule file can come from anywhere, even across the network! <P>

Applications do not have to provide native support for all protocols, they can in many situations
rely on the support of proxies and gateways to help doing the job. Proxy servers are often used to
carry client requests through a firewall where they can provide services like corporate caching and
other network optimizations. Both Proxy servers and gateways can serve as "protocol translators"
which can convert a request in the main Web protocol, HTTP, to an equivalent request in another
protocol, for example NNTP, FTP, or Gopher. In case a proxy server or a gateway is available to the
application, it can therefore by use of HTTP forward all requests to for example a proxy server
which then handle the communications with the remote server, for example using FTP about the
document and return it to the application (proxy client) using HTTP.

<H3>Initialization Modules</H3>

The core parts of the Library is a framework for adding functionality. It has hooks for adding
protocol modules, like for example HTTP, FTP, and also for adding streams that can convert from one
media type to some other type, or presenting the result to the user. In the distribution file of the
Library you will find a large set of protocol modules and streams already implemented. However, in
order to use these you need to initialize them. This can be done by using the methods in the <A
HREF="WWWInit.html">WWWInit</A> module. You can modify these modules as you like to fit your
particular needs. The modules in this interface are <B>not</B> part of any DLL and so must be
included directly if desired.

</PRE>

In addition top the basic W3C Reference Library include file called <A
HREF="WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> you <EM>can</EM> also include this
file called WWWApp.h depending on the needs of your
application. However, it is not required and none of the files
included below are ever used in the core part of the Library
itself. Only if this file is included, the extra modules will get
included in the linked object code. It is also possible to include
only a subset of the files below if the functionality you are after is
covered by them.

<H2>Generating the First Anchor</H2>

This module provides some "make life easier" functions in order to get
the application going. They help you generate the first anchor, also
called the <EM>home anchor</EM>. It also contains a nice set of
default WWW addresses.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTHome.html">HTHome.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H2>User Dialogs and Messages</H2>

You can register a set of callback functions to handle user prompting,
error messages, confimations etc. Here we give a set of functions that
can be used on almost anu thinkable platform. If you want to provide
your own platform dependent implementation then fine :-)

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTDialog.html">HTDialog.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H2>After Terminating a Request</H2>

When a request is terminated, the application often has to do some
action as a result of the request (and of the result of the
request). The Application part of the Library provides two following
modules to handle <EM>logging</EM> and <EM>history
management</EM>. You can register a <EM>POST request handler</EM> in
the <A HREF="HTNet.html">Net Manager</A> as described in the <A
HREF="../User/Using/Overview.html">User's Guide</A>. <P>

You can find a function called <CODE>HTLoadTerminate</CODE> in the <A
HREF="HTHome.html">HTHome module</A> that enables all the functionality
for handling a request result.

<H3>Logging</H3>

Often it is required to log the requests issued to the Library. This
can either be the case if the application is a server or it can also
be useful in a client application. This module provides a simple
logging mechanism which can be enabled if needed.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTLog.html">HTLog.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>History Management</H3>

Another type of logging is keeping track of which documents a user has
visited when browsing along on the Web. The Library history manager
provides a basic set of functionality to keep track of a linear
history list.

<H3>Cache Manager</H3>

Caching is a required part of any efficient Internet access
applications as it saves bandwidth and improves access performance
significantly in almost all types of accesses.  The Library supports
two different types of cache: The memory cache and the file cache. The
two types differ in several ways which reflects their two main
purposes: The memory cache is for short term storage of graphic
objects whereas the file cache is for intermediate term storage of
data objects. Often it is desirable to have both a memory and a file
version of a cached document, so the two types do not exclude each
other. <P>

The cache contains details of temporary disk files which contain the
contents of remote documents.  There is also a <A
HREF="HTAnchor.html#z1">list of cache items for each URL</A> in its
anchor object. <P>

There are various ways of handling Expires header when met in a
history list. Either it can be ignored all together, the user can be
notified with a warning, or the document can be reloaded
automatically. This flag decides what action to be taken. The default
action is HT_EXPIRES_IGNORE. In HT_EXPIRES_NOTIFY mode you can specify
a message to tell the user (NULL is valid in which case my own message
pops up - watch out it might be in Danish ;-)) <P>

The Library has two notions of a local cache: a file cache and a
memory cache. The memory cache is handled by the client and the file
cache is handled by the Library. Often the format of a object cached
in memory is in the form of a hypertext object ready to be displayed
(that is, it's already parsed).

The core part of the Library is designed as a set of registration

functionality comes when the applciation registeres the modules that
provides a desired functionaly, for example accessing HTTP servers or
the local file system. The Library has a special include file called
<A HREF="WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A> which contains all converters,
protocol modules, and a lot of other "sugar" modules that can make the
core a very powerful Web interface. You can include this one if the
application is to use all the functionality of the Library.

This interface provides functionality for guessing unknown media types
from magic words. The stream is a one that reads first a chunk of
stuff, tries to figure out the format, and calls
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This is a kind of lazy-evaluation of
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This could be extended arbitrarily to
recognize all the possible file formats in the world, if someone only
had time to do it. <P>

The core parts of the Library is a framework for adding
functionality. It has hooks for adding protocol modules, like for
example HTTP, FTP, and also for adding streams that can convert from
one media type to some other type, or presenting the result to the
user. In the distribution file of the Library you will find a large
set of protocol modules and streams already implemented. However, in
order to use these you need to initialize them. This can be done by
using the files in the <A HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit</A> module. You
can modify this module as you like to fit your particular needs.

file depending on the needs of your application. However, it is not
required and none of the files included below are ever used in the

<H3>Rule File Management</H3>

Another way to initialize applications is to use a rule file, also
known as a configuration file. This is for example the case with the
W3C httpd and the W3C Line Mode Browser. This module provides basic
support for configuration file management and the application can use
this is desired. The module is not referred to by the Library. Reading
a rule file is implemented as a stream converter so that a rule file
can come from anywhere, even across the network!

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTRules.html">HTRules.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Proxies and Gateways</H3>

Applications do not have to provide native support for all protocols,
they can in many situations rely on the support of proxies and
gateways to help doing the job. Proxy servers are often used to carry
client requests through a firewall where they can provide services
like corporate caching and other network optimizations. Both Proxy
servers and gateways can serve as "protocol translators" which can
convert a request in the main Web protocol, HTTP, to an equivalent
request in another protocol, for example NNTP, FTP, or Gopher. In case
a proxy server or a gateway is available to the application, it can
therefore by use of HTTP forward all requests to for example a proxy
server which then handle the communications with the remote server,
for example using FTP about the document and return it to the
application (proxy client) using HTTP.

The Utility modules are mostly container modules, dynamic strings and
otherstuff that you can't live without when building applications. The
modules are used by the core part of the W3C Reference Library but can
also be used by the application. See also the main Library include
file called <A HREF="WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> which contains all
converters and protocol modules known to the Library. You can include
this one if the application is to use all the functionality of the
Library.

<H3>Dynamic Arrays</H3>

This module implements a flexible array of pointers. It is a general
utility module.  An array is a structure which may be extended.  These
routines create and append data to arrays, automatically reallocating
them as necessary.  It is garanteed that the last entry in an array is
<B>NULL</B>

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTArray.html">HTArray.h</A>"

<H3>Association Lists</H3>

This is a small module build on top of the <A
HREF="HTList.html">HTList module</A> that provides a way to store
<EM>Name-Value</EM> pairs in an easy way.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTAssoc.html">HTAssoc.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Atoms</H3>

Atoms are strings which are given representative pointer values so
that they can be stored more efficiently, and comparisons for equality
done more efficiently. The pointer values are in fact entries into a
hash table.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTAtom.html">HTAtom.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Dynamic Strings</H3>

A Chunk is a block wise expandable array of type (char *) and is a sort of
apology for real strings in C. Chunks make it easier to handle dynamic strings
of unknown size. It is often faster than using the String Copy Routines</A>.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTChunk.html">HTChunk.h</A>"

<H3>Linked Lists</H3>

This module provides the functionality for managing a generic list of
data objects. The module is implemented as a single linked list using
the scheme <EM>first in - last out (FILO)</EM>.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTList.html">HTList.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Dymamic Memory Management</H3>

This module implements a dynamic memory API that is used throughout
the Library. The API covers three types of functionality:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#d">Handling of allocation and deallocation of dynamic memory</A>
<LI><A HREF="#r">Recovering from temporary lack of available memory</A>
<LI><A HREF="#p">Panic handling in case a new allocation fails</A>
</UL>

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTMemory.html">HTMemory.h</A>"

<H3>String Utilities</H3>

Routines for dynamic arrays of characters include string copy,
case insensitive comparison etc.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTString.html">HTString.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>UU encode and decode</H3>

File module provides functions functions for uuencode and decode
strings which convert a buffer of bytes to/from RFC 1113 printable
encoding format. This technique is similar to the familiar Unix
uuencode format in that it maps 6 binary bits to one ASCII character
(or more aptly, 3 binary bytes to 4 ASCII characters).  However, RFC
1113 does not use the same mapping to printable characters as
uuencode.
