<H1>The BUILD Script</H1>

The <EM>BUILD</EM> script is placed in the <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory
and you can use it to compile and link the W3C applications. The
<EM>BUILD</EM> script figures out what platform you are on and
generates a <CODE>Makefile</CODE> which consists of a platform
independent part and a platform dependent part. The independent stuff
is all in

<PRE>
	WWW/&lt;application&gt;/Implementation/CommonMakefile
</PRE>

whereas the platform dependent stuff can be found in 

<PRE>
	WWW/All/&lt;platform&gt;/Makefile.include
</PRE>

The <CODE>Makefile.include</CODE> contains all platform specific
compiler flags, linker flags etc. If you encounter problems with the
compiler, for example if you don't have it, then modify the flags in
this file and retry <EM>BUILD</EM>. <P>

If your application is not mentioned in the <A HREF="./">Platform</A>
page then read this section to find out about the <EM>BUILD</EM>
script and how to port the source code to your platform. We assume you
have a unix-like environment, including some sort of C (either
Kernigan and Ritchie or ANSI) compiler, and a socket library
supporting TCP/IP communications. If you are on a PC platform, VMS or
other then it might require some more hard work depending on the
application you want to port.<P>

<UL>

<LI>Make a new subdirectory under <CODE>WWW/All</CODE> and give it a
name that is characteristic to your platform. Often you can use the
name given by the <CODE>uname</CODE> command:

<LI>Copy the <CODE>Makefile.include</CODE> from another (similar)
machine's subdirectory. You can find similar platforms for almost any
known Unix platform into the new directory.

<LI>Modify the <CODE>Makefile.include</CODE> as necessary to compile
and install on your system. This involves selecting the compiler
command, flags, etc, to be used, and specifying directory names.

<LI>Add a line to the <EM>BUILD</EM> script so that the
<CODE>WWW_MACH</CODE> environment variable can be set. You can often
see how to do this by looking at the other entries in this file.

<LI>Try out the <EM>BUILD</EM> script by typing in the
<CODE>WWW</CODE> directory

<PRE>
	./BUILD
</PRE>

If the code doesn't compile then you have to look into the source code
itself. Often the only module to modify is the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/tcp.html">tcp module</A> which includes all
system specific details such as system include files etc.

<LI>Mail the Makefile, and any other changes you found were necessary,
back to us (<EM>libwww@w3.org)</EM> so that other people can get the
changes as well.

</UL>

Now you can install the software according to the instructions given
under the status page of the application you want to install.
