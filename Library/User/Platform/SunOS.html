<H1>Notes About Sun OS</H1>

These are the installation and user notes for the <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/">W3C httpd</A>, the <A
HREF="../../">W3C Reference Library</A> and the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>. Any
comments and suggestions are welcome at

<H2>Resolver Library</H2>

An often encountered problem using Sun OS is that you get the error
message back:

<PRE>
	Can't locate remote host
</PRE>

This is due to a problem with the way SunOS does name resolution. By
default it uses NIS as the resolver and then if this fails then it
tries the DNS server. However, sometimes it doesn't work and the
result is the message above. <P>

A way to short circuit the NIS system is to link the application with
an external resolver library. In the case where you are building the
code yourself this can be done by making a change to the <A
HREF="Porting.html">Makefile.include</A> file and then rebuild the
application. If you are using a precompiled binary then take the
<B>lresolve</B> version.
