<H1>Notes About OSF/1</H1>

There are some problems with the <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/">W3C httpd</A> running on an OSF/1
version 3.0 platform. I have got this information from Per Steinar
Iversen &lt;PerSteinar.Iversen@fi.uib.no&gt; which will integrate the
W3C httpd better into OSF/1 3.0: <P>

The following little script eliminates this and integrates httpd
better into OSF/1 V3.0:

<PRE>
#!/sbin/sh
#
# Start httpd.
#
PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
export PATH
#
NNTPSERVER=&lt;your.news.server&gt;
export NNTPSERVER
#
unset ftp_proxy
unset gopher_proxy
unset http_proxy
unset news_proxy
unset wais_proxy
umask 022
#
case "$1" in
'start')
	echo "Starting HTTPD..." 
       	/usr/local/www/httpd -r /etc/httpd.conf 
        ;;
'stop')
	echo "Shutting down HTTPD..."
#	kill -9 `cat /usr/local/www/httpd-pid`
# Note: skill removes *all* httpd childen...
	/usr/local/bin/skill -9 httpd 
        ;;
*)
        echo "usage: $0 {start|stop}"
        ;;
esac
#
</PRE>

When the script is put into <CODE>/sbin/init.d/httpd</CODE> and have
softlinks from <CODE>/sbin/rc3.d/S97httpd</CODE> and
<CODE>/sbin/rc3.d/K02httpd</CODE> - then httpd starts/stops nicely
integrated in the OSF/1 fashion, just like the DEC daemons does. "man
rc3" for more info. <P>

Note the setting/unsetting of critical variables. Also the setting of
umask - httpd just uses whatever root had at start-time, annoying for
log-files. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/32x32/warning.gif" ALT="NOTE"> We have
recently received the following information from Eric R Schott
<EM>&lt;schott@zk3.dec.com&gt;</EM> about the script itself and where
to put it:<P>

<UL>
<LI>This example uses a local script that most Digital UNIX (aka DEC
OSF/1) platforms don't have (reference to /usr/local/bin/skill)
<LI>It is correct to place it in /sbin/init.d
<LI>It is correct to soft link it to /sbin/rc3.d/S97httpd
<LI>It should NOT be linked as /sbin/rc3.d/K02httpd
<LI>INSTEAD, it should be soft linked as /sbin/rc0.d/K02httpd
<LI>AND it should be soft linked as /sbin/rc2.d/K02httpd
</UL>
