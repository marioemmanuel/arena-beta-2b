<H1>Building on Windows</H1>

When building the W3C Reference Library on a Windows platform (Windows 3.1, 95, or NT), you can
decide on a set of different options to be enabled or disabled. This document describes the set of
DLLs and how they can be built. C compilers on Windows platforms often have a notion of
<EM>projects</EM> that define what files to include in the compilation and where to put the
output. This document does not describe the process of creating projects as it depends on the
compiler that you are using but refers you to your C compiler manuals.

<A NAME="select"><H2>Interleaved vs Asynchronous Sockets</H2></A>

Non-blocking network access can either be done using multiplexed I/O or asynchronous
I/O. Multiplexed I/O is based on an eventloop with a <CODE>select()</CODE> system call. The
<CODE>select()</CODE> system call is a function that scans a set of BSD like socket descriptors and
returns when one or more sockets are ready for either network <B>read</B> or
<B>write</B>. Asynchronous I/O is based on signals instead of a <CODE>select()</CODE> call. Each
time a socket is ready for a network operation, for example <B>read</B>, a signal is generated. This
signal can then be caught by the application in an signal handler. Using the <CODE>select()</CODE>
call is called <EM>reactive</EM> whereas using signals is called <EM>pro-active</EM>. <P>

The W3C Reference Library supports both approaches under Windows, and therefore you must choose
which model you prefer. The choice can depend on what type of application you are using and what
other libraries you are using.

<A NAME="unix"><H3>Interleaved I/O Using select()</H3></A>

In this mode the <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTEvntrg.html">Event Manager</A> registers all
active sockets and passes them to a <CODE>select()</CODE> call which then processes the registered
sockets. When <CODE>select()</CODE> returns the Event Manager dispatches the appropriate handlers as
the sockets get ready. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet.gif"> <B>What to do:</B> <EM>Undefine</EM> <B>WWW_WIN_ASYNC</B>
as a preprocessor directive when generating the project for the Library. Please make sure that
<EM>all</EM> DLLs are compiled without this flag.

<A NAME="async"><H3>Asynchronous I/O based using Signals</H3></A>

Here the <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTEvntrg.html">Event Manager</A> registers all active sockets
using <CODE>WSAAsyncSelect</CODE> which is part of the WinSock API. When <CODE>AsyncSelect()</CODE>
which is the asynchronous equivalent to the <CODE>select()</CODE> returns, the Event Manager
dispatches the results of the <CODE>AsyncSelect()</CODE>. As the asynchronous select call needs a
windows handle, the Library creates a <EM>hidden window</EM> in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAccess.html#Library">Library initialization function</A>. This window
is <EM>not</EM> to be used explicitly by the application and the Library closes the window when
exiting.<P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet.gif"> <B>What to do:</B> <EM>Define</EM> <B>WWW_WIN_ASYNC</B> as
preprocessor directives when generating the project for the Library.

<A NAME="io"><H2>Console vs Windows Application</H2></A>

A Windows application can use either a character based command line interface, or a graphic windows
interface. Many MS-DOS applications do run as a simple command line tool which doesn't use GUI at
all. Under Win32, there is a notion of a <A HREF="#console">console</A> application. This means that
all user interaction happens through a standard DOS shell interface, with a FILE pointer like that
in Unix. This does not exist under Win16, where a Windows window is required. <P>

The Library supports both the console and the windows interface, and again you must choose what
version you prefer. This is often something you have to decide as you are creating the project.

<A NAME="windowed"><H3>Windows Application</H3></A>

If you want to make a windows application then this is the mode to use. Eric Prud'hommeaux has
provided a Windows application wrapper for the <A HREF="../../../LineMode/">W3C Line Mode
Browser</A> which you can use in order to build the browser as a Windows application. This is found
in <A HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/windows/www.c">www.c</A>. Three other modules, <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/windows/scroll.c">scroll.c</A> and <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/Implementation/windows/lib.c">lib.c</A> provide the window for the
application. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet.gif"> <B>What to do:</B> Define <B>_WINDOWS</B> as preprocessor
directives when generating the project for the Library.

<A NAME="console"><H3>Console Application</H3></A>

The console option is available only in Win32 in which case all user interaction happens through the
Win32 console window. This model strongly resembles a Unix vt100 terminal interface. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet.gif"> <B>What to do:</B> Define <B>_CONSOLE</B> as preprocessor
directives when generating the project for the Library.

<A NAME="lib"><H2>Static vs Dynamic Libraries</H2></A>

Windows has a concept of both static and dynamic libraries, the latter also known as
<EM>DLLs</EM>. It is out of scope here to describe the difference between DLLs and static libraries,
but as DLLs is based on a lot more flexible memory model it is almost always the best solution for
Windows applications. <P>

The W3C Reference Library support both models in that if can be built as either one big static
library or as a set of small DLLs. As mentioned, it is in almost all cases recommended to build DLLs
instead of static libraries, and on Win16 it is required because a static library is too big.

<A NAME="static"><H3>Static Library</H3></A>

The libraries may be build as one large static library. This is how libwww is implemented on Unix
platforms. Subsequent references to the various DLLs may all be assumed to refer to the staticly
linked libwww. Care has been taken to insure that there are no <I>#define</I> conflicts where one
library would want a <I>#define</I> that would interfere with the modules in other libraries. When
building a static library, see the following sections on <A HREF="#select">Select Options</A> and <A
HREF="#io">Input/Output Options</A>, accumulate all the <I>#defines</I> that are required, and build
the whole libwww with those <I>#defines</I>. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet.gif"> <B>What to do:</B> <EM>Undefine</EM> <B>WWW_WIN_DLL</B> as
preprocessor directives when generating the project for the Library. Please note, that it is not
recommended to staticly link to the libraries if you are building a Win16 application as it creates
segment size problems.

<A NAME="dynamic"><H3>Dynamic Libraries (DLLs)</H3></A>

The libwww can also be built as a set of DLLs that follows the modular architecture of the
Library. This enables the application programmer to choose exactly what functionality should be
enabled in the application.  The boundaries between these DLLs are based on module interdependency
and some assumptions regarding which modules may be replaced by the application.  Unlike static
linking, dynamic linking requires that all the modules in a DLL be replaced at once. This is because
the DLL needs all internal references to be resolved at build time. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet.gif"> <B>What to do:</B> Define <B>WWW_WIN_DLL</B> as
preprocessor directives when generating the project for the Library.

<H3>Special Windows DLL</H3>

In addition to platform independent modules, there is a small Windows specific DLL which implements
the trace message generation. The DLL is called <CODE>windll.dll</CODE> and contains also the
definition of the global trace flag definition.

<UL>
<LI><I>windll.c</I> - DLLMain to ALL DLLs.
<LI><I>wwwdll.c</I> - instances of PTTYPrint and WWW_TraceFlag. This is included in wwwdll so that
it can export the variables to the rest of the DLLs.
<LI><I>wwwdll.def, wwwutils.def, wwwcore.def</I> - def (exports) files for the DLLs of the same
names.
</UL>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet.gif"> <B>What to do:</B> Include the windll.dll as a part of
your project and make sure that it is built as the first DLL.

<H3>Exporting Functions from DLLs</H3>

The functions exported from a DLL are listed in the EXPORTS section of a .def file. These can be
found in the <A HREF="../../Implementation/windows">windows</A> directory. These may also be build
by the <A HREF="../../Implementation/windows/makedefs.pl">makeDefs.pl</A> perl script, see the
description below. You can use the def files as a basis for generating the DLL projects for your
compiler. <P>

<IMG SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/bullet.gif"> <B>What to do:</B> Generate the DLLs according to the def
files so the exported interface is identical to the set of functions defined in the actual c files
included in the DLL.

<H2>Make Files and Projects</H2>

Unfortunately, make files are not easily shared among different C compilers on Windows which
complicates the distribution. We can not support all of them but we can give some hints which may
help you to get going.

<H3>Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0</H3>

In the distribution file you can find a complete <A
HREF="../../Implementation/windows/msvc_40.mak">Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 Project</A> that builds the
W3C Reference Library as a set of DLLs as described in the <A HREF="../../User/Guide/">Library
Internals</A>.

<H3>Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0</H3>

You can also find a set of Microsoft 2.0 make files in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/windows/">windows directory</A> of the distribution file. However, as
version 2.0 does not support having one single Make file, you must compile the set described by the
<A HREF="../Guide/Interfaces.html">following list of DLLs</A> in the order they are listed. Please
note that these files may be slightly out of date as we do not update them as often as the MSVC 4.0
files.

<H3>Microsoft Visual C++ 1.x</H3>

A problem with the MSVC 1.5 compiler is that it doesn't get the dependencies right. It includes all
<CODE>#include</CODE> directives even tough that some of these directives are for Unix only and the
include files don't exist on windows. The only way to get around this is to manually edit the
project make files generated by MSVC 1.x and take out the dependencies of files that are not
intended for the Windows platform. Compiling on a 16 bit platform may also cause some trouble as we
don't really support that.

<H3>Borland C Compiler</H3>

The Borland C compiler has a different DLL interface where you need to use the reserved word
<CODE>export</CODE> in front of all methods and data objects to be exported from a DLL. This is not
currently the case but you can use the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/windows/makexprt.pl">makexprt.pl</A> Perl script to change the Library
code.

<H3>Other Compilers</H3>

You can often use this project as the basis for porting the make file. The DLL description also
various from compiler to compiler which can cause that you can't use the DLL def files directly. We
try to make as generic solutions as possible but have limited resources to provide projects for
multiple compilers.

<A NAME="makedefs"><H3>makeDefs.pl</H3></A>

<A HREF="../../Implementation/windows/makedefs.pl">makeDefs.pl</A> is a perl 4 script which takes a
list of modules and generates a list of exports from them. The module list may be taken from the
appropriate header file for the library, e.g. <I>wwwutils.dll</I> uses <I>wwwutils.def</I> which is
made from <I>WWWUtils.html</I>. The file list assumes nothing except the module file names with no
extensions so each line that says: <I>#include "some file.h"</I> should be translated to <I>some
file</I>.  As of the time of this writing, there were to ways in which the library header files must
be modified to give an accurate list of the modules in a library. In WWWCore.html, <I>HTReq.h</I>
should translate to <I>HTReqMan</I> and in WWWUtils.html, <I>HTUtils.h</I> should be removed from
the list.
