<A HREF="http://websco.sco.com/Technology/ga/#httpd">This binary release of httpd 3.0 is provided by SCO</A> <P>

This binary release of httpd 3.0 is provided by SCO as a Technical
Library Supplement (TLS).  The httpd software was written by Ari
Luotonen, Henrik Frystyk, Tim Berners-Lee.  Source code and complete
online documentation is freely available from W3C: <P>

</PRE>

TO INSTALL THIS SUPPLEMENT, extract the cpio archive as user 'root' from
any directory: <P>

<PRE>
	# cpio -idum -I ARCHIVE
</PRE>

where "ARCHIVE" is the filename of the cpio archive or the device node
where the archive can be found (e.g. /tmp/tls070.cpio, or /dev/install). <P>

<H2>SOFTWARE NOTES:  W3C httpd for SCO</H2>

<H3>Making documents publicly available</H3>

httpd is configured by default to make public all documents in the
"directory" /var/opt/cern_httpd/htdocs.  That "directory" is actually
a symbolic-link which points to a real directory. <P>

As provided, the /var/opt/cern_httpd/htdocs symbolic-link points
to a sample document directory containing one "Welcome" document. <P>
	
In order to allow the server to provide access to your own direc-
tory of documents, you must replace that symbolic-link with one
which points to your own public directory.  To do so, execute
these commands as user 'root':

<PRE>
	# cd /var/opt/cern_httpd
	# rm htdocs
	# ln -s /your/pub/dir htdocs
</PRE>

Users of SCO's Global Access 1.0 product may wish to form a
symbolic-link which points to their existing public directory
(e.g. /var/opt/httpd/htdocs). <P>

Alternately, advanced users may wish to configure different direc-
tories in the httpd.conf file.

<H3>Running httpd</H3>

To run httpd, execute this shell-script as user 'root':

<PRE>
	# /opt/cern_httpd/bin/cern_httpd  [ -v ]
</PRE>

Normally, the server will place itself into the background after
starting up, returning you to a prompt.  The optional -v argument
forces the server to run in the foreground and provide verbose
debugging output.  See the online documentation at W3C for more
information about other command-line options. <P>

Note that if you are already running any httpd daemon on port 80
(e.g. from Global Access 1.0), you will need to kill the httpd process
before starting up httpd on port 80. <P>

You may wish have the server start up automatically at boot-time.
To do so, add a script to the /etc/rc2.d directory (or modify an
existing 'http' script) to run the command-line above (without
the -v option). <P>


<H3>Configuring httpd.conf</H3>

httpd relies on the single configuration file

<PRE>
	/var/opt/cern_httpd/httpd.conf
</PRE>

In order to use certain features of the server (proxy, caching),
you must make changes this file, but it is provided "ready to use"
for basic configurations. <P>

See the online documentation at W3C for information about con-
figuring the server.  Also note that the original example config-
uration files from the httpd 3.0 distribution are available in the
directory /opt/cern_httpd/sample-config.  See the README file in that
directory for more details. <P>

<H3>Log Files</H3>

httpd is configured to store its log files in the directory:

<PRE>
	/var/opt/cern_httpd/logs
</PRE>

The default configuration provided has logging enabled, so be sure
to clean out the logs periodically.

<P>
