<H1>Known Bugs and Patches</H1>

The list of known bugs are in reverse chronological order. Please report bugs or bug-fixes to <A
HREF="mailto:libwww@w3.org">libwww@w3.org</A> noting the version of the Library and what caused the
bug to appear. <P>

The provided patches are relative to the <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory in the distribution tree. In
order to apply a patch, do the following in the <CODE>WWW</CODE> directory:

<OL>

<LI>Download the patch, for example <EM>lib-1.fix</EM>

<LI>Invoke the patch command by typing 

<PRE>
	patch &lt; lib-1.fix
</PRE>

<LI>Rebuild the code by typing

<PRE>
	make clobber
	./BUILD library
</PRE>
</OL>

You should only apply patches under the section with <B>same</B> version number as your current
version. You can see the current version of this software by looking into the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/Version.make">version file</A>.

<H2>Library 4.0D</H2>

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="lib_4.0_2.fix">Patch for better logging</A>
<DD>
</DL>

<H2>Library 4.0C</H2>

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="lib_4.0C_1.fix">Patch for PUT and POST</A>

<DD>This patch is rather big but it contains some fixes and modifications that enables PUT and POST
to work reliably. If you download the 4.0C version of the distribution then the patch has already
been applied. It is basically the difference between versions 4.0B and 4.0C. The main set of differences are:

<UL>

<LI>Automatic redirection and Access authentication has been take n out of the HTTP module. Instead
the new mechanism with request callback functions are used so that the application can register
handlers to handle these situations. The reason for this change is that not all applications are
interested in having this functionality performed automatically.

<LI>Authentication handler and redirection handler added to both the Line Mode Browser and the Command Line Tool

<LI>Added three possible return codes on which a request callback function can be called:

<UL>
<LI>HT_PERM_REDIRECT for permanently moved objects
<LI>HT_TEMP_REDIRECT for temporarily moved objects
<LI>HT_NO_ACCESS for insufficient credentials
</UL>

<LI>PUT and POST do now work reliably in the Line Mode Browser and the Command Line Tool. Both can
PUT or POST a document <B>from</B> either a remote HTTP server <EM>or</EM> the local file system
<B>to</B> a remote HTTP server.

<LI>An important bug-fix in the internal event manager that prevented a socket to be registered for
multiple events at the same time.

<LI>Cleanup of the POSTWeb management in the file module and the HTTP module

<LI>In addition to progress notification on READ we now support progress notification when sending a data object

<LI>Spelling mistake fixed. <EM>preemtive</EM> is changed to <EM>preemptive</EM>

<LI>The W3C Mini Robot has now the ability to stop at a certain depth while traversing the Web.

</UL>

<H2>Library 4.0</H2>

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="lib_4.0_1.fix">SGML fix from Maciej Puzio for better error handling</A>

<LI><A HREF="lib_4.0_bug_3.html">Generating DLLs under Windows using Borland compilers</A>

<LI>Bug in management of <A HREF="lib_4.0_bug_2.html"><EM>select()</EM> timeout handler</A>

<LI>Bug in <A HREF="lib_4.0_bug_1.html"><EM>no-proxy</EM> directive</A>

<LI>HTML Machinery is still missing a great deal. However this part is now isolated into the
SGML-HTML-HText stream pipe and will be replaced by a new parser as soon as possible in connection
with the development of Arena.

<LI>Directory listings do not work completely on Windows NT

</UL>

<H2>Library 3.1</H2>

<DL>

<DT>Bug in time stamp on files in FTP directory listings

<DD>The Library supports "long" directory listings for FTP Unix, VMS
and Windows NT servers with file type, size, time and date
etc. However, the time stamp is wrong by one hour for files created
when daylight saving time is enabled. The reason is that the FTP module
in the Library doesn't know the time-zone of the remote FTP server and
hence doesn't know when DSR is enabled or disabled. This is fixed in
the next version

<DT><A HREF="lib_3.1_1.fix">Problem with nested HTML tags in the HTML parser</A>

<DD>A bug which makes the HTML parser crash if is gets more than 20
nested HTML tags. Thanks to Robert M. Fleischman for pointing this
out!

</UL>

<H2>Library 3.0</H2>

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="lib_3.0_1.fix">Problems with redirection</A>

<DD>Until now all HTTP servers have sent back a small HTML document with a 
redirection message going:

<PRE>
	If you can see this message then your browser
	does not support automatic redirection.
</PRE>

However, new severs like Netscape and other servers don't send this
and hence no stream should be set up. This confuses the Library and it
dumps core.
