<H2>Release 4.0D February 12 1996</H2>

This upgrade release fixes some bugs and it adds functionality for posting data from memory. This is
the full list of changes:

<UL>

<LI>Optimized HTTP request header by taken away an "Accept:" line pr accepted content type and
instead use the commna notation.

<LI>Introduced <A HREF="../Implementation/HTMemory.html">HTMemory</A> as dynamic memory handler. This
module is a part of the <A HREF="../Implementation/WWWUtil.html">WWWUtils interface</A> and it
handles better management of dynamic memory.  You can find a full description in the <A
HREF="Using/Memory.html">User's Guide.</A>

<LI>We now have an updated list of <EM>all</EM> public functions exported from the Library. It's
available as <A HREF="../Implementation/windows/wwwlist.txt">wwwlist.txt</A>

<LI>We also present an updated list of <EM>all</EM> public interfaces available in the Library. You
can find it in the <A HREF="Guide/Interfaces.html">Library Internals</A>.

<LI>PUT and POST from memory is implemented. You can now post data from memory using the POSTWeb
model as for posting remote data objects. The Interface is described in <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTAccess.html">HTAccess module</A>. There is a very small dummy test
implemented in the Line Mode browser. You can activate it if you type<EM>edit</EM> from the command
line.

<LI>The Mini server now runs (although crude) as a proxy. It is capable of serving data as a
HTTP/HTTP proxy. It is based on the internal Library event loop and is therefore highly portable. It
is not intended to be a full featured server but a test implementation which shows how to use the
Library in server applications.

<LI>Bug fixed that caused the following problem: If there hasn't been made a connection between the
net->target and the request->output_stream then the latter is not freed if the request is
interrupted.

<LI>The <EM>referer URL</EM> header can now contain a unlimited length URL

<LI>A resolver callback function has been introduced in the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTTee.html">HTTee stream</A>. This allows the caller to assign a callback
function to resolve conflicts between the return codes of the two streams.


<LI>The request object as been added as a calling parameter to the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">HTFWrite stream creation method</A>. This allows errors from
writing to a file to propagate back to the request object.

<LI>The three streams <CODE>HTSaveLocally</CODE>, <CODE>HTSaveAndExecute</CODE> and
<CODE>HTSaveAndCallBack</CODE> have been optimized and they now all use the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">HTFWrite stream creation method</A>

<LI>We have a new module called <A HREF="../Implementation/HTTPGen.html">HTTPGen</A>. It generates
general HTTP headers. These headers were a part of the MIME header generator, but by isolating them,
we can use the MIME header as a generic MIME entity header generator.

<LI>Created <A HREF="../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">HTErrorStream</A> which always returns
HT_ERROR. It replaces the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTFWrite.html">HTBlackHole</A> has been replace
with HTErrorStream in many places in order to speed up performance

<LI>Made HTTP response stream (which parses the response line only) into a converter so that we can
forward the output exactly as received from the remote HTTP server. This is important for proxy
applications and other applications that want to see the output untouched.

<LI>The HTChunk module has been made more solid and the amount of memory allocations has been
limited.

<LI>Memory cleanup fixed in content length counter stream and FTP module

<LI>Introducing HT_CLOSED and HT_PAUSE for handling streams. This was required, especially after HTTP
supports persistent connections where a document is not delimited by a closed connection.

</UL>

<H2>Release 4.0C January 23 1996</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Automatic redirection and Access authentication has been take n out of the HTTP module. Instead
the new mechanism with request callback functions are used so that the application can register
handlers to handle these situations. The reason for this change is that not all applications are
interested in having this functionality performed automatically.

<LI>Authentication handler and redirection handler added to both the Line Mode Browser and the Command Line Tool

<LI>Added three possible return codes on which a request callback function can be called:

<UL>
<LI>HT_PERM_REDIRECT for permanently moved objects
<LI>HT_TEMP_REDIRECT for temporarily moved objects
<LI>HT_NO_ACCESS for insufficient credentials
</UL>

<LI>PUT and POST do now work reliably in the Line Mode Browser and the Command Line Tool. Both can
PUT or POST a document <B>from</B> either a remote HTTP server <EM>or</EM> the local file system
<B>to</B> a remote HTTP server.

<LI>An important bug-fix in the internal event manager that prevented a socket to be registered for
multiple events at the same time.

<LI>Cleanup of the POSTWeb management in the file module and the HTTP module

<LI>In addition to progress notification on READ we now support progress notification when sending a data object

<LI>Spelling mistake fixed. <EM>preemtive</EM> is changed to <EM>preemptive</EM>

<LI>The W3C Mini Robot has now the ability to stop at a certain depth while traversing the Web.

</UL>

<H2>Release 4.0A December 11 1995</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Created the include HTTPUtil.html - a C file may follow
<LI>Changed HTDoAccept so that it automatically inserts the new socket descriptor in the Net object.
<LI>HTLoad_terminate moved from HTReqMan to HTHome. It is not
  automatically set up in HTLibInit anymore 
<LI>Made HTAnchor and HTLink opaque data objects
<LI>changed HTAnchor_linkResult to HTLink_result
<LI>changed HTAnchor_linkMethod to HTLink_method
<LI>Changed HyperDoc to simply a void pointer. This makes it more
  generic and the application does not have to actually treat it as a
  document anyway
<LI>Introduced the WWW_DEBUG internal format that can be used to
  redirect debug information, for example from a HTTP redirection
  message etc.
<LI>Request object added to HText_new methods
<LI>changed HTExtParse to HTXParse throughout - H&kon
<LI>HTXParse now null-terminates buffer - H&kon
<LI>return codes from HTTee changed - H&kon
<LI>content-length initialized to -1 - H&kon
<LI>Fixed bug for handling HEAD in HTTP and MIME streams
<LI>Handles of persistent connection is now a semaphore and not a bool
<LI>Changes the event loop so that a timeout handler can return HT_OK or
  HT_ERROR. If the code is not HT_OK then stop the event loop
<LI>Changed request of header enumeration:
<UL>
<LI>General headers have the prefic HT_G_
<LI>Request headers have the prefic HT_C_
<LI>Server headers have the prefic HT_S_
<LI>Entity headers have the prefic HT_E_
</UL>
<LI>Separated file suffix initialization into HTBInit
<LI>Changed the names in HTChunk to be consistent with the Module_method scheme
<LI>Introduced HTBInit.c for setup of file suffixes
</UL>

<H2>Release 4.0 December 1 1995</H2>

<H2>Alpha Release 7, November 28 1995</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Added a backlog parameter to the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTTCP.html">HTDoListen() function</A>

<LI>Added a parameter for handling <CODE>server modules</CODE> to the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTProt.html">Protocol</A> module. An access scheme (for example HTTP, can
now be registered together with a <EM>client module</EM> and a <EM>server modele</EM>

<LI>Added <A HREF="../Implementation/HTAccess.html">HTServDocument</A> to the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTAccess.html">HTAccess module</A> in order to better support server
applications.

<LI>Made <A HREF="../Implementation/WWWNews.html">WWWNews.html</A>, <A
HREF="../Implementation/WWWHTTP.html">WWWHTTP.html</A>, <A
HREF="../Implementation/WWWMIME.html">WWWMIME.html</A>, and <A
HREF="../Implementation/WWWFTP.html">WWWFTP.html</A> include files to be used by applications.

<LI>Changed functions with the name <CODE>preemptive</CODE> to <CODE>preemptive</CODE> it was a spelling mistake
</UL>

<H2>Alpha Release 6, November 20 1995</H2>

<UL>

<LI>Removed remaining <CODE>ARGS</CODE> and <CODE>PARAMS</CODE> from the sources. All function
declarations and definitions now follow the ANSI standard.

<LI>Changed <A HREF="../Implementation/HTAlert.html">HTAlert</A> to be a registration module instead
of a module to be overriden by an application. Now you can register a <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTDialog.html">Dialog</A> module as a callback function which is a much more
generic moduel. It also means that there are no more English text in the <A
HREF="../Implementation/WWWCore.html">Core</A> of the Library - it's all in a application
module. The Library provides a default implementation in the new <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTDialog.html">HTDialog</A> module.
 
<LI>Taken the WWW relevant stuff out of <A HREF="../Implementation/HTString.html">HTString</A> and
put it into the new module called <A HREF="../Implementation/HTWWWStr.html">HTWWWStr</A>. The latter
is a part of the core whereas the former is generic string utilities.

<LI>Made the global variable <CODE>HTLibraryVersion</CODE> local to <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTAccess.html">HTAccess</A>. The are now only <CODE>WWW_TraceFlag</CODE>
left as a global variable in the whole Library.

<LI>There are now four main include files. They are called:

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="../Implementation/WWWUtil.html">WWWUtil.h</A>
<DD>The WWW Utility module contains a lot of the functionality that makes it possible to make
applications, that is container modules for data objects, basic string functionality etc. This
module is the basis for all of the following modules and is used extensively.

<DT><A HREF="../Implementation/WWWCore.html">WWWCore.h</A>
<DD>The WWW Core module is a set of registration modules that glues an application together. It
contains no real functionality in itself; it is for example not capable of loading a HTML
document. It only provides a large set of hooks which can be used to add functionality to the
Library and to give an application real life. We will here a lot more to the structure of the core,
and much of this guide is actually describing how to add functionality to the core.

<DT><A HREF="../Implementation/WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A>
<DD>This include is the main include file for the Library. It basically consists of the WWWUtil.h
and the WWWCore.h so that the application only needs to include this one instead of two.

<DT><A HREF="../Implementation/WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A>
<DD>This module contains a huge set of modules that can be hooked into the Core Library and make the
application work. In contrast to the Core part, you can pick exactly the modules you want from the
WWWApp.h in order to create your special application whether it is a server, a client, a proxy, a
robot or any other Web application.
</DL>

<LI><A HREF="../Implementation/HTGuess.html">HTGuess stream</A> is now a converter just like any
other converter, and it can be registered by the application if wanted

<LI><CODE>HTClientHost</CODE> (global var) is removed from the Library as it wasn't use there at all

<LI>Introduced <A HREF="../Implementation/HTHome.html">HTHome module</A> as part of the application
specific part of the Library. It contains handy functions for the application.

<LI>HTFindRelatedName() and HTHomeAnchor() are moved from HTAccess.c to the new module HTHome.c

<LI>HTImProxy is taken out as it can be handled in the setup of the converters

<LI>Created HTList_appendObject() in <A HREF="../Implementation/HTList.html">HTList module</A> which
adds an element to end of list

<LI>Introduced pre request callback functions in HTNet and changed the interface. It's described in
User's Guide. This means that an application can register any action to be executed either
<EM>before</EM> and/or <EM>after</EM> a request is done. This is described in detail in the <A
HREF="Using/Net.html">User's Guide.</A>

<LI><A HREF="../Implementation/HTHome.html">HTHome module</A> contains default callback functions to
be called before and after a request.

<LI>Removed the HTInputSocket_get* functions from <A HREF="../Implementation/HTSocket.html">
HTSocket</A> as they are no more needed (they were non-reentrant and belonged to the old interface)

<LI>Added the following HTLib_* functions to the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTAccess.html">HTAccess
module</A>:

<UL>
<LI>CONST char * HTLib_name (void)
<LI>CONST char * HTLib_version (void)
<LI>BOOL HTLib_secure (void)
<LI>void HTLib_setSecure (BOOL mode)
</UL>

<LI>Library is now handling cleanup of anchors in HTLibTerminate() as it really is a part of the core.

<LI>Default addresses are taken out of HTAccess and added to HTHome. They were mainly some default
addresses for <CODE>WWW_HOME</CODE> etc.

<LI>The Library is now not using env variables at all

<LI>The flag <CODE>WWW_WIN_ASYNC</CODE> introduced to use the new async window interface. Add this
define to your project if you want it

<LI>HTsocketWin and HTwinMsg made internal to HTEvntrg.c. They can now be accessed through the methods

<UL>
<LI>HTEvent_setWinHandle
<LI>HTEvent_winHandle
</UL>

<LI>Added the following formats to the default initialization:

<PRE>
	www/unknown -> HTGuess_new
	text/x-www-rules -> HTRules
</PRE>

<LI>Changed format <EM>image/x-tiff</EM> to <EM>image/tiff</EM> and <EM>image/x-png</EM> to
<EM>image/png</EM>

<LI>Finished the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTNews.html">News module</A> using non-preemptive
sockets. Final testing is still missing

<LI>Changed HTRules so that it now is a stream. It also handles line wrapping and has a much more
solid parsing mechanism. See description in <A HREF="Using/Rules.html">User's Guide</A> for more
details.

</UL>


<H2>Alpha Release 5, November 8 1995</H2>

The Library has now undergone a major restructuring in order to define the APIs between the various
parts and to make it more modular. The new architecture is described in the <A
HREF="Architecture/DesignModel.html">Architecture document</A> and includes a new Net manager that
handles a request queue, a DNS manager that handles persistent connections and a well defined
Request manager where the HTRequest object is an opaque object.

<H3>Core Modules</H3>

<UL>

<LI>Generalized the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTError.html">Error Manager</A> to work on lists
instead of as directly on a request object. This makes it possible to use the error manager in all
situations.

<LI>Changed <EM>HTAppName</EM> and <EM>HTAppVersion</EM> to parameters to HTLibInit() instead of as
global parameters.

<LI>Introduced a new main include file called <A HREF="../Implementation/WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A>
which contains applications specific modules. None of these modules are actually required to compile
and link the Library, but the application can use them if needed.

<LI>None of the access modules (HTTP, FTP, NNTP, etc.) are set up by default anymore. This is now
for the applications to do.

<LI>Changed <EM>TRACE</EM> to <EM>WWWTRACE</EM> as it interferes with macro on NT

<LI>The balanced binary tree in <A HREF="../Implementation/HTBTree.html">HTBtree</A> is not used
anymore. The functionality is now provided by the new <A HREF="../Implementation/HTArray.html">
HTArray module</A> that is a dynamic array of pointers. It is much like the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTChunk.html">HTChunk module</A> but for pointers instead of dynamic
strings. The advantage is that the fast <EM>qsort</EM> algorithm can be used on the array.

<LI>Moved the two functions <CODE>HTWWWTLocal()</CODE> and <CODE>HTLocalToWWW()</CODE> from the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTFile.html">HTFile Module</A> to the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTString.html">HTString module</A> for converting between local file names
and URLs

<LI>It is now possible to register a call back function together with a timeout that is used in the
select call of the event loop. When the select() call times out, the call back function is
called. The registration can either be so that the call back <EM>always</EM> is called when that the
select call times out <EM>or</EM> only when Library sockets are in use.

<LI>We have a port to PowerMac and 68K!!! This has been provided by Steven T. Roussey
&lt;sroussey@eng.uci.edu&gt; and Brad Barber &lt;barber@well.com&gt;

<LI>We have changed HTThread to <A HREF="../Implementation/HTNet.c"> HTNet.c</A> as thread was too
confusing. This module has been cleaned up and rewritten so that <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTNet.c">HTNet.c</A> now contains the Net manager. The Net manager controls
the net access so that we only keeps a specified amount of sockets open simultaneously (called a
request queue). It also partly controls the management of persistent connections together with the
<A HREF="../Implementation/HTDNS.html"> DNS Manager.</A>

<LI>The <EM>HTRequest Object</EM> is now known to the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTReq.html">Request
Manager</A> only. It is accessible through a lot of methods just like the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTAnchor.html">Anchor object</A> etc. The <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTAccess.html">HTAccess module</A> is now a user interface to the Request
Manager but it doesn't have to be used - you can use the Request Manager directly but often it is
easier to go through the Access Module.

<LI>The Protocol object has been turned into an object internal to the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTProt.html">Protocol manager</A>. This means that protocol information can
be accessed via a set of methods provided by the manager.

<LI>We have changed case sensitive search to insensitive search when finding an access methods
(HTTP, FTP, telnet etc.) for a URL. This catches silly errors in URLs like
<EM>HTTP://www.foo.com</EM>

<LI>The static protocol declarations have been replaced with a set of parameters to the creation
method of a protocol object in the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTProt.html"> Protocol Manager</A>
which is more handy.

<LI>We added HTProtocol_delete() as method in the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTProt.html">Protocol
manager</A>. This means that it is now possible to <EM>unregister</EM> a protocol at runtime. If you
are on a platform with dynamic linking (for example DLLs) then this can save a lot of space.

<LI>Introduction of application call back function for memory cache. This is a part of separating
the <A HREF="../Implementation/HText.html">HText module</A> and also to make the memory cache
manager more flexible. An example implementation can be found in the <A
HREF="../../LineMode/Implementation/GridText.c">GridText module</A> in the <A
HREF="../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A>.

<LI>Full support for the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#links">HTLink object</A> that
binds together two anchors. This is a requirement for keeping track of the <A
HREF="Architecture/PostWeb.html">Post Web</A>.

<LI>URL fragment identifiers were case insensitive - they are now case sensitive

<LI>Added <CODE>result</CODE> field to the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#links">
HTLink</A> so that the result of a posting operation is stored in the link object. This means that
the application can see which post operations succeeded and which didn't. This can for example be
used in a GUI client to show the relations between the source and destination anchor as "dim" links.

<LI>Fixed bug in put mechanism that caused destinations to accumulate in the postweb. Now `old'
destinations are still registered but not included in a new postweb - they can, however, be
discarded all together, but often the information is nice to have. On a GUI client, it can be shown
as 'dimmed' destinations.

<LI>Removed remaining outputs directly to stdout using <EM>fprintf()</EM>. Now all goes through <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTAlert.html"> HTAlert module</A>. This was a problem in some of the
protocol modules as well (especially in the Telnet module).

<LI>The <CODE>CacheItems</CODE> structure is removed from anchor object and replaced by <CODE>(BOOL)
CacheHit</CODE>. If <CODE>CacheHit=YES</CODE> then the format negotiation and suffix binding is not
used in <A HREF="../Implementation/HTFile.html">HTFile Module</A> but the object is loaded directly
(from the local file cache) using non-blocking I/O

<LI>Internal DNS/hostname cache optimized and made more flexible to support <B>persistent
connections</B> for all protocols that support this, for example HTTP, FTP, and NNTP. The first
version has support for HTTP only, but the other ones will follow shortly. and multiple connections
to same address. You can now control the garbage collection of DNS entries based on time. The DNS
object keeps also information about the remote server (class of request, for example HTTP or FTP and
the type of server, for example HTTP/1.0, HTTP/0.0 etc.). This means that it is possible to adjust a
request to a remote server once the type is known. For example, the Library now distinguishes
between HTTP servers version 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1. New classes and versions can be registered at run
time just like protocol modules.

<LI><A HREF="../Implementation/HTTCP.html">HTDoConnect</A> rewritten as a state machine which makes
it a lot easier to understand and change. It is furthermore and important part of the persistent
connection management.

<LI>Removed <CODE>HTMaxRedirect</CODE> as a global variable. It is now private to <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTReq.html">Request manager</A> with two methods to access it

<LI>Support for context swapping and call back function in the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTReqMan.html">HTRequest object</A>. This allows the application to
distinguish between multiple ongoing requests. See more information in the <A
HREF="Using/Access.html">User's Guide</A>.

<LI>Bug fix in <A HREF="../Implementation/HTTCP.c">HTTCP.c</A> HTGetHostName thanks to "dave (d.)
mielke" &lt;davem@bnr.ca&gt;

</UL>

<H3>Protocol Modules</H3>

<UL>

<LI>We have a first version of a new <A HREF="../Implementation/HTNews.html">News module</A> which
supports POST, persistent connections and a lot of more efficient NNTP commands.

<LI>Re-implemented long directory listings for FILE and FTP access using streams. The HTML machinery is
now separated into the new <A HREF="../Implementation/HTDir.html">HTDir module</A>. It provides long
directory listings for Unix, NT, and VMS.

<LI>Support for <B>persistent connections</B> in HTTP requests. This has been enabled by the generic
model in the DNS manager.

<LI>Support for the methods <EM>DELETE</EM>, <EM>LINK</EM>, and <EM>UNLINK</EM>.

<LI>Re-implemented <A HREF="../Implementation/HTFTP.html">HTFTP</A> module using <B>persistent
connections</B>, multiplexed (non-blocking) sockets and streams for input and output. In fact the
FTP module is now very capable and it's <EM>half</EM> the size of what it was because the Library in
general supports the features needed in the FTP module. NOTE: Generation of HTML objects from
directory listings is disabled for the moment as we are re-implementing it using streams. However,
now it is possible to get the raw source code directly from the FTP server by typing:

<PRE>
	www -source ftp://ftp.w3.org
</PRE>

<LI>Re-implemented <A HREF="../Implementation/HTGopher.html">Gopher module</A> so that it uses
streams for input and output instead of the obsolete <A HREF="../Implementation/HTSocket.html">
HTSocket_getCharacter()</A> method. The module now also uses non-blocking I/O as the HTTP module and
the file module. A result of using streams is that you now can obtain the "real" source (the ASCII
object sent by the gopher server) by using <EM>WWW_SOURCE</EM> as the output format. Before the
source was equivalent of the source of the HTML object that was generated on the fly.

<LI>Updated <A HREF="../Implementation/HTTelnet.c">Telnet module</A> to understand URL format
<EM>user:passwd@host:port</EM>. Cleaned up the code and fixed a set of bugs at the same time.

<LI>Support for <EM>Host</EM> header in <A HREF="../Implementation/HTTPReq.html">HTTP Request
module</A>. Actually this was <EM>Orig-URI</EM> but it was changed on the fly.

<LI>Fixed bug on HTTP redirect if no body part was present. This is the new "trend" especially from
Netscape's server. The old servers always sent back a small HTML document explaining if the client
didn't understand automatic redirect.

</UL>

<H3>Stream Modules</H3>

<UL>

<LI>We now have a <A HREF="../Implementation/HTBound.html">MIME multipart parser stream</A> which
supports nested MIME multipart messages. This stream sets up a new MIME parser stream each time it
finds a new body. Preamble and epilog messages are ignored by default but can be redirected to the
special <A HREF="../Implementation/HTReq.html">Debug Stream</A> output of the Request object.

<LI>We have added a content counter stream and a buffer stream in <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTConLen.html">HTConLen module</A>. This can be used to count the number of
bytes in a data object either to be sent to a remote server or as a check of a received
body. Together with the Content Length counter stream there is also a buffer stream that can buffer
up to a certain amount of dat before it goes transparent.

<LI>We have replaced the internal format identifier <CODE>www/mime</CODE> with the MIME conforming
<CODE>message/rfc822</CODE> format. This may affect the setup of stream converters that used the old
format.

<LI>We have also added a new <A HREF="../Implementation/HTMIMERq.html">HTMIMERq module</A> which is
responsible for creatin MIME metainformation when sending requests. This is used, for example, by
the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTTP.c">HTTP protocol module</A> and the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTNews.c">NNTP protocol module</A>

<LI>For the first time, it is <EM>not</EM> required to define dummy definitions of the external
declared function in the <A HREF="../Implementation/HText.html">HText Interface</A>. It is now only
referenced from the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTML.html">HTML module</A> and the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTPlain.html">Plain Text Presentation module</A>. This means that
applications that do not use the HTML/HText interface no more have the modules linked into the final
object code.

<LI>The <A HREF="../Implementation/SGML.html">SGML module</A> is no longer included anywhere anymore
except where necessary. The structured stream definition can be found in <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTStruct.html">HTStruct module</A>

<LI>Make registration of callback function for unknown MIME headers in the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTMIME.html">MIME parser</A>. The application can now more easily experiment
with new headers. The registration process is described in the section <A HREF="Using.html">How to
get Started Writing an App</A>

<LI>Added support for png (lossless graphics format) (patch from unknown?) into the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTGuess.html">Guess stream</A>

<LI>Bug fixed in <A HREF="../Implementation/HTML.html">HTML parser</A> It couldn't handle more than
20 nested HTML tags which can happen for example in auto-generated HTML documents.

<LI>HTLoadError taken out completely. Replaced by the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTError.html">error
manager</A>. It was for (stupid) historic reasons put into the HTML parser.

</UL>

<H3>Application Modules</H3>

<UL>

<LI><A HREF="../Implementation/HTAlert.html">HTInteractive</A> made a private flag to <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTAlert.c">HTAlert.c</A>. It can now be reached via two methods in the
module.

<LI>All functions in the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTAlert.html">Alert Module</A> now has a request
object as part of the calling parameters. The reason is that then the implementation of this module
can call a registered call back function (as described above) so that the user message can be put
into the right context.

<LI>Mem leak fixed in <A HREF="../Implementation/HTLog.html">HTLog module</A> and added result of
request to the log file. The log module is no longer called in the Library at all so if you do not
use then it is not included in the application.

<LI>Rewritten <A HREF="../Implementation/HTHist.html">HTHistory module</A> to perform a better
history mechanism - the old version did not work properly. Some of the new features are

<UL>
<LI>Support for multiple history lists. You can use the context information in the request
object to find the right list at any given time.
<LI>The list now supports both <EM>back</EM> and <EM>forward</EM> for navigation. The list is no
more "back trace with deletion".
</UL>

See <A HREF="Using/History.html">User's Guide</A> for more information

<LI>Introduced <A HREF="../Implementation/HTAlert.html">HTProgress()</A> notifications for the
following operations

<UL>
<LI>DNS lookup
<LI>connect to remote host (either passive or active)
<LI>read data from network
<LI>write data to network
<LI>request finished
<LI>waiting for free socket
</UL>

On each of these operations, the library calls <EM>HTProgress()</EM> with a code so that the
application can define what to do with it.

</UL>

<H3>Generic Utilities</H3>

<UL>

<LI>Introduced HTChunkData() and HTChunkSize() as methods in the <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTChunk.html">HTChunk module</A>. No more need to look into the HTChunk
object itself.

<LI>Changed HTStat to HT_STAT and HTLStat to HT_LSTAT as they are macros

<LI>The <CODE>HTSimplify()</CODE> function in the <A HREF="../Implementation/HTParse.html">HTParse
module</A> now follows the <A HREF="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/rfc1808.txt">RFC 1808
Specification</A>

<LI>Fixed bug in <A HREF="../Implementation/HTParse.c">HTCanon()</A> that got confused about
&lt;http://teller.datawave.net:80/test/../imx/weelogo.gif&gt; thanks to Henry Minsky

<LI><A HREF="../Implementation/HTParse.c">HTCanon()</A> made private to <A
HREF="../Implementation/HTParse.html">HTParse module</A> as it is called from HTSimplify() only

<LI>All <EM></EM> replaced with <EM>(wb|ab)</EM> if known binary output. This was a problem on
Windows 3.1 platform as it inserted extra <EM>CRLF</EM> line terminators.

<LI>Created HTNumToStr() in <A HREF="../Implementation/HTString.html">HTString Module</A> to convert
a number to a string using prefixes. This can be used in the progress notification to write <EM>Read
1.6K</EM> etc.
