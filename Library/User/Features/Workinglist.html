<H1>Working Plan W3C Reference Library</H1>

This is the current work plan for new features and changed interfaces
for the W3C Referene Library. <P>

<H2>Initial Plan for Next release <IMG ALT="NEW" SRC="../../../Icons/WWW/new_red.gif"></H2>

<DL>

<DT>Memory Resource Handler

<DD>The Library needs a mechanism to allow to get around situations when memory is exhausted.

<DT>Better debug and trace messages facilities

<DD>Currently all debug messages are included in all versions of the Library. In order to
distinguish between debug versions and release versions, the debug messages should only be included
in the debug version.

<DT>Experimenting with HTTP protocol implementations including HTTP/1.x, PEP and <A HREF="../../../Protocols/HTTP-NG/">HTTP-NG</A>

<DD>An important part of the W3C software is to provide reference implementations of the Web
protocols. The next release will provide important new features in this area.

<DT>Integration with <A HREF="ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/ilu.html">ILU</A> from Xerox Parc

<DD>Integrating ILU and libwww is part of the experiments with HTTP-NG and it also allows for better
integration between various programming languages.
