<H1>The Anchor Object</H1>

Anchors represent any references to data objects which may be the
sources or destinations of hypertext links. This section contains a
general description of the model used to bind anchors together in an
internal representation in the <A HREF="../../">W3C Reference
Library</A>.

The anchors are organized into a <EM>sub-web</EM> which represents the
part of the web that the application (often the user) has been in
touch with. In this sub-web, any anchor can be the source of zero,
one, or many links and it may be the destination of zero, one, or many
links. That is, any anchor can point to and be pointed to by any
number of links. Having an anchor being the source of many links is
often used in the POST method, where for example the same data object
is to be posted to a News group, a mailing list and a HTTP
server. This is explained in the section "<A
HREF="PostWeb.html">Building a POST Web, an API for PUT and
POST</A>"<P>

Every data object has an anchor associated with it. Anchors exist
throughout the lifetime of the application, but as this generally is
not the case for data objects, it is possible to have an anchor
without a data object. If the data object is stored in the file cache
or in memory, the parent anchor contains a link to it so the
application can access it either directly or through the <A
HREF="./#ClientCache">file cache manager</A>. There are two
types of anchors in the Library:<P>

<DL>
<DT><EM>parent anchors</EM>

<DD>Represents whole data objects. That is, the destination of a link
pointing to a parent anchor is the full contents of the data object.
Parent anchors are used to store all information about a data object,
for example the content type, language, and length.

<DT><EM>child anchors</EM>

<DD>Represents a subpart of a data object. A subpart is declared by
making a NAME tag in the anchor declaration and a child anchor is the
destination of a link if the HREF link declaration contains a "#" and
a tag appended to the URI. Child anchors do not contain any
information about the data object itself. They only keep a handle (or
a "tag") pointing into the data object kept by the corresponding
parent anchor.

</DL>

Both types of anchors are subclasses of a <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTAnchor.html#Generic">generic anchor
class</A> which defines a set of outgoing links to where the anchor
points. Every parent anchor points to an address which may or may not
exist. In the case of posting an anchor to a remote server, the
address pointed to is yet to be created. The client can assign an
address for the object but it might be overridden (or completely
denied) by the remote server. The relationship between parent anchors
and child anchors is illustrated in the figure.

<OL>

<LI>Parent anchors keep a list of its children which is used to avoid
having multiple example of the same child and in the garbage
collection of anchors.

<LI>All child anchors have a pointer to their parent as only the
parent anchors keep information about the data object itself. Parent
anchors simply have a pointer to themselves.

<LI>Every parent anchor have an address which is a URL pointing to a
resource that may or may not exist.

<LI>Parents can have a data object associated using the HyperDoc
object. In this case anchor <B>B</B> and <B>C</B> has a data
object but <B>A</B> hasn't which can either be because the anchor has
not yet been requested or the data object has been discarded from
memory by the application.

<LI>Any anchor can have any number of links pointing to a set of
destinations. In most situations there is only one destination, but
multiple destinations is typical when posting data objects to a remote
server.

<LI>This anchor has two destinations. By default the main destination
will be the one selected.

<LI>Parent anchors keep a list of other anchors pointing to it. This
information is required if a single parent anchor (and its children)
is removed from the sub-web.

</OL>
