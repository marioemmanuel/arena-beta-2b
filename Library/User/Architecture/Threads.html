<H1>Net Objects and Libwww Threads</H1>

In a single-process, single threaded environment all requests to, for example, the I/O interface
blocks any further progress in the process.  Any combination of a multiprocess or multi threaded
implementation of the Library makes provision for the application to request several independent
documents at the same time without getting blocked by slow I/O operations. As a Web application is
expected to use much of the time doing I/O such as "connect" and "read", a high degree of
optimization can be obtained if multiple threads can run at the same time.<P>

Library version 3.0 was designed to be thread compatible. It can either be used with conventional
threads or with the <A HREF="../Architecture/Threads.html">"libwww thread" concept</A> which allows
an application to handle requests in a constrained asynchronous manner using non-blocking I/O and an
event loop based on a select system call. As a result, I/O operations such as establishment of a TCP
connection to a remote server and reading from the network can be handled without letting the user
wait until the operation has terminated. Instead the user can issue new requests, interrupt ongoing
requests, scroll a document etc. <P>

Version 3.1 of the Library has an enhanced libwww thread model as it supports writing large amount
of data from the application to the network, also using non-blocking I/O operations. The main
purpose of Librray 3.1 was to provide a basic support for remote collaborative work through the <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP</A> methods <B>PUT</B> and <B>POST</B>. <P>

As libwww threads are not really threads but a notion of using non-blocking I/O for accessing data
objects from the network (or local file system), it can be used on any number of platforms with or
without native support for threads, and this section describes the model behind libwww threads and
how it affects applications.</P>

<H2>The Net object</H2>

The <EM>Net object</EM> contains all the state information required to stop and start execute a
request using asynchronous IO. The use of aynchronous IO has an important implication on the
implementation of the access modules in the Library, for example the HTTP module which is explained
later: <P>

<UL> 

<LI>Global variables can be used only if they at all time are independent of the current state of
the active Net object.

<LI>Automatic variables can be used only if they are initialized on every entry to the function and
stay state independent of the current request throughout their lifetime.

<LI>All information necessary for completing a request must be kept in an autonomous data object
that is passed round the via the stack.

</UL>

<P><IMG SRC="Thread.gif"><P>

The main reason for keeping the Net object separate from the Request object is that some requests
require more than one Net object, for example FTP which has a Net object for the control TCP
connection and a Net object for each data TCP connection. In the case of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1,
there is a 1:1 correspondance between a Net object and a request object. In HTTP/1.2 a Net object
can live longer than a single request as persistent connections might handle a set of requests over
the same TCP socket. Net objects can be used in three different ways:

<OL>
<LI>All requests are preemptive and all I/O is blocking
<LI>Requests are non-preemptive managed by an <EM>internal</EM> event loop
<LI>Requests are non-preemptive managed by an <EM>external</EM> event loop
</OL>

The three modes are described in more detail in the section on <A HREF="Events.html">Internal and
External Events</A>. In mode 2) the Net objects is used to make the binding between the socket based
internal event loop (using a <CODE>select()</CODE> call) and a request, so that a socket ready for
an I/O action can make the corresponing libwww thread active. In mode 1) and 3) Net objects
represents the socket interface of a request.

<H2>Creation and Termination of a Net object</H2>

A Net object is created by the Net manager from within the Request manager every time a request is
passed to the Library. A request can either be issued by the application or the Library itself for
example as a result of redirection, access authentication, or when a new data connection is created
in a FTP request. All new Net objects are automatically associated with a group which might already
exist or be created together with the new Net object.<P>

When a Net object has been created, the Request manager returns immediately to the caller and does
not see the request before it has terminated either with a success or an error as result. The
request can either be started immediately by the Net manager or put into a queue if the maximum
number of open TCP connections is reached. When a request is terminated there are typically a set of
tasks that the application would like to do:

<UL>
<LI>Update the history list
<LI>Report the result to the log manager
<LI>Update the display
<LI>etc.
</UL>

Handling the termination of a request is based on call back functions that can be registered in the
Net manager dynamically at run time. Multiple call back functions can be registered in which case
they are all called from the Net manager in the sequence they were registered. As an example, the
Request manager registers a call back function to handle the status of the request regarding to some
internal actions. This function is registered at initialization time of the Library. The application
can add its own call back functions to be called on termination of a request.
