<H1>The Protocol Object</H1>

The Core Library doesn't know anything about protocol modules. This has the big advantage that an
application can register any number of protocols including access to the local file system. The
Library core is independent of whether you make an application capable of speaking all known Internet
protocols or only can access, for example a HTTP server - to the Library it's all a set of callback
functions. <P>

The Protocol object handles two types of callback functions: one for a client application and one
for a server application. This means that you can register not only any type of protocol clients but
also their server counterparts. Whether it is a client module or a server module, a protocol module
is identified by an access scheme which is identical to the access scheme known from the URL syntax,
for example

<PRE>
	<B>http</B>://www.w3.org
	<B>ftp</B>://ftp.w3.org
	etc.
</PRE>

The <A HREF="../Using/Methods.html">User's Guide</A> describes in detail how you can set up the
protocol modules in your application.
