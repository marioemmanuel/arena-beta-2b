<H1>Introduction</H1>

The W3C Reference Library is a general code base that can be used as a
basis for building a large variety of World-Wide Web applications. Its
main purpose is to provide services to transmit data objects rendered
in many different media types either to or from a remote server using
the most common Internet access methods or the local file system. It
provides plain C reference implementations of those specifications and
is especially designed to be used on a large set of different
platforms. Version 3.1 supports more than 20 Unix flavors, VMS,
Windows NT, and ongoing work is being done to extend the set of
platforms.<P>

Even though plain C does not support an object oriented model but
merely enables the concept, many of the data structures in the Library
are derived from the class notation. This leads to situations where
forced type casting is required in order to use a reference to a
subclass where a superclass is expected. The forced type casting
problem and inheritance in general would be solved if an object
oriented programming language was to be used instead of C, but the
current standardization and deployment level of object oriented
languages in general would imply that a part of the portability would
get lost in the transition. There are several intermediate solutions
under consideration where one or more object oriented APIs built on
top of the Library provides the application programmer with a cleaner
interface. <P>

Many of the features of the Library are demonstrated in the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> which is a text
terminal client built right on top of the Library. Even though this
application is usable as an independent Web application, its main
purpose is to show a working example of how the Library can be
used. However, it is important to note that the Line Mode Browser is
only <EM>one</EM> way of using the Library and many other applications
may want to use it in other ways.<P>

The development of the W3C Reference Library was started by <A
HREF="../../../People.html#BernersLee">Tim Berners-Lee</A> in 1990,
and today the Library is a multi functional code base with a large
amount of knowledge about network programming and portability built
into it with help from <A HREF="../../../People.html#Luotonen">Ari
Luotonen</A>, <A HREF="../../../People.html#Groff">Jean-Francois
Groff</A>, <A HREF="../../../People/howcome/">H&aring;kon W. Lie</A>
and a large number of people on the Internet.
