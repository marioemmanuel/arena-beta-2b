<H1>DNS Cache and Host Name Canonicalization</H1>

An excessive communication with remote Domain Name Servers (DNS) can
produce a significant time-overhead in requesting a document from a
remote server which can result in degraded performance of the
application. This is often the case in spite of DNS's own cache, as
the request still has to cross the network. In order to prevent this,
the Library has its internal memory cache of host names which is
updated every time a host name is looked up in the DNS cache. Once the
host name has been resolved into an IP-address, it is stored in the
cache. The entry stays in the cache until either an error occurs when
connecting to the remote host or it is removed during garbage
collection. However, as the information kept in the cache is fairly
small, it can contain a large set of elements.<P>

Multi-homed hosts are treated specially as all available IP-addresses
returned from DNS are stored in the cache. Every time a request is
made to the host, the time-to-connect is measured and a weight
function is calculated to indicate how fast the IP-address was. The
weight function used is

<P><IMG ALT="Weight function" SRC="../Paper/Equation.gif"><P>

where <IMG ALT=alpha" SRC="../Paper/alpha.gif"> indicates the
sensitivity of the function and <IMG ALT="Delta"
SRC="../Paper/Delta.gif"> is the connect time. If one IP-address is
not reachable a penalty of x seconds is added to the weight where the
penalty is a function of the error returned from the "connect"
call. The next time a request is initiated to the remote host, the
IP-address with the smallest weight is used. <P>

A problem with both the host name cache and the data object cache is
to detect when two URLs are equivalent. The only way this can be done
internally in the Library is to canonicalize the URLs before they are
compared. This has for some time been done by looking at the path
segment of the URLs and remove redundant information by converting
URLs like

<PRE>
	foo/./bar/ = foo/redundant/../bar/ = foo/bar/
</PRE>

The method is optimized and expanded so that also host names are
canonicalized. Hence the following URLs are all recognized to be
identical:

<PRE>
	http://www/ = http://www.w3.org:80/ = http://Www.W3.Org/ =
	http://www.w3.org./ = http://www.w3.org/
</PRE>

However, the canonicalization does not recognize alias host names
which would require that this information is stored in the cache. In
order to do this, a separate resolver library must be provided as this
information is normally not returned by the default resolver
libraries. Also these library do not support non-blocking sockets and
hence delay can not be avoided when resolving a host name. The
solution is of course to write a resolver library which handles these
features, and it is under consideration.
