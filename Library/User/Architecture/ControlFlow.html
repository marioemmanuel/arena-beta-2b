<H1>Overview of the Core</H1>

The main concept in the Library is a "request/response" model where an
application issues a request for a URI (URL). The Library then tries
to fulfill the request as efficient as possible either by requesting
the URL at the origin server, a proxy server, a gateway, directly from
the local file system, or a locally cached version. Data is delivered
back to the application as soon as it gets ready which guarantees
minimum access delay for the application. From version 3.0, the
Library supports threads including its own platform independent thread
model called "<A HREF="Threads.html">libwww threads</A>". This allows
multiple requests to be handled simultaneously without blocking the
application while waiting on data. <P>

<H2>Requests and Responses</H2>

The "request/response" model is illustrated in the control/data
diagram shown below. The diagram shows only the core modules - the
other modules are "pasted in" later. Note, that the Library code is to
the right of the thick vertical line (green), and the application to
the left can be any type of application, for example a proxy or a
client. The architecture of the Library does support clients and
proxies in pretty much the same way as it makes little difference to
the Library: a client has a user interface whereas a server has a
network interface. It is a good idea to study the <A
HREF="../../../LineMode/">Line Mode Browser</A> and the <A
HREF="../../../Daemon/">httpd</A> as reference implementations using
the Library to see this duality.<P>

Another thing to note is that the Library from version 3.1 supports
large scale data flow from the application to the network as well as
from the network to the application. This has an important impact on
the functionality that can be put into applications, for example
allowing collaborative authoring possibilities via the Web. The
architecture behind this is described in the section <A
HREF="PostWeb.html">"Post Webs - an API for PUT and POST"</A>.

<P><IMG SRC="LibCore.gif" ALT="Flow"><P>

The thin lines (red) is control flow, the thick lines (blue) is data
flow and the "lightning" (magenta) is control flow as a result of
events handled by the Library. Let's see what happens when an
application issues a request. The description is based on having an
event loop - this can either be the one provided by the Library or an
external event loop provided by the application. The section on <A
HREF="Threads.html">libwww threads</A> explains more on how this can
be set up. The numbers refer to the figure above.

<OL>

<LI>The event manager is waiting for an event from the application.  This can for example be a user
clicking the mouse on a link or types a number on the keyboard. When an event arrives, the event
manager calls the user event handler provided by the application.

<LI>The user event handler creates a request object and uses one of the load methods.

<LI>The Request object creates a new Net object.

<LI>The Net object calls any call back functions registered to be called <EM>before</EM> the request
is actually started. This can for example be mapping the URL to another destination, checking the
cache, look for proxy servers and gateways etc.

<LI>if the request has to access the net then the Net object passes it to the protocol object 

<LI>The <EM>after</EM> callback functions are called when the request is terminated. Types of
operations you want to make here can for example be logging, history update etc. If the
<EM>before</EM> call back functions implies that no net access is required then the protocol object
is not used at all.

<LI>The event callback function is now called to actually get the document.

<LI>When data is arriving then the Format manager is contacted to build a stream stack.

<LI>The converted data is either handed from the network to the application <EM>or</EM> from the
application to the network as it gets ready. If no data is ready, control is given back to the event
manager.

<LI>If an error occurs then a dialog callback function is called to notify the user

</OL>

This description is the "macro" description of how the core modules
interact and in the rest of this document we shall see more of the
details of what is going on inside the core modules and what objects
are involved. Note that by using a threaded model, the Library can
handle multiple requests simultaneously. An example on how to do this
is described in the section "<A HREF="Threads.html">Libwww
Threads</A>".

<DL>

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTReq.html">Request Object</A>
<DD>The access manager is the main entry point for requesting a data object pointed to by a URI. It
has a set of methods that allows the application to request different services, for example to get a
URI, post a URI, or to search a URI.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTProt.html">Protocol Object</A>

<DD>The protocol manager is invoked by the access manager in order to
access a document not found in memory or in cache. The manager
consists of a set of protocol modules handling the access schemes
HTTP, FTP, NNTP, Gopher, WAIS, Telnet, and access to the local file
system. The protocol modules are registered dynamically (using static
linking) and the <A HREF="../Using/">User's Guide</A> describes how
modules can be registered. Each protocol module is responsible for
establishing the connection to the remote server (or the local
file-system) and extract information using a specific access
method. When data arrives from the network, it is passed on to the
format manager.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTFormat.html">Format Manager</A>

<DD>The stream format manager takes care of the transportation of
streams of data from the network to the application and vice versa. It
also performs any parsing and data format conversion requested based
on a set of registered format converters and a simple algorithm for
selecting the best conversion. As the protocol modules, data format
converters can be registered dynamically, and the current set of
streams includes among others: MIME, SGML, HTML, and LaTeX.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTError.html">Error Object</A>

<DD>This module manages an information stack which contains
information of all errors occurred during the communication with a
remote server or simply information about the current state. Using a
stack for this kind of information provides the possibility of nested
error messages where each message can be classified and filtered
according to its impact on the current request, for example "Fatal",
"Non-Fatal", "Warning" etc. The filtering can be used to decide which
level of messages will be passed back to the user.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTNet.html">Net Object</A>

<DD>The net manager provides an interface for handling asynchronous
sockets which is an integral part of the Library.

<DT><A HREF="../../Implementation/HTEvntrg.html">Event Manager</A>

<DD>The event manager is a "session layer" handling which thread
should be the active thread. A thread can either be an internal libwww
thread or an external thread, for example a Posix thread, and the
event manager can itself be either the internal Library manager or an
external event manager. Currently the internal event manager uses a
select function call to decide which thread should be made the active
one, however an external event manager can use another decision
model. One of the design ideas behind the event manager is that it can
be extended to a full session layer manager handling for example the
control of a HTTP-NG connection. The event manager is described
together with the internal thread model in the section "<A
HREF="Threads.html">Libwww Threads</A>".
