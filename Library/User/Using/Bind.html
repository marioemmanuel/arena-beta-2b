<H1>Bindings to the local File system</H1>

The preferences that we described in section <A HREF="Prefs.html">Request Preferences</A> did not
mention what the Library should do if it doesn't know the data format of a document. In many
protocols this information is provided by the remote server. Typical examples are MIME like
protocols where the metainformation such as the <EM>Content-Type</EM> and the
<EM>Content-Language</EM> is provided together with the document. However, applications often have
access to the local file system using <B>file</B> URLs which in general do not keep any or at least
very little information of the file type. It is therefore required to have some kind of binding
between the file system and the preferences registered in the Library which provides this
mateinformation about the object. <P>

Often files in a file system is classified by some sort of a suffix, for example GIF files are often
ending in <EM>.gif</EM>, text files in <EM>.txt</EM> etc. This binding is not static and it is
therefore required to have a dynamic binding just like the preferences themselves. An example of the
latter is HTML files which on most Unix systems end in <EM>.html</EM> whereas they on many MS-DOS
based systems end in <EM>.htm</EM>. <P>

The <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTBind.html">HTBind module</A> provides a generic binding
mechanism between a file and its representation internally in the Library. It is not limited to
simple file suffix classification but can also be used in more advanced environments using data
bases etc. However, at this point we are interested in how we can register bindings between file
suffixes and for example content types, content languages etc. <P>

Before starting a more detailed description of how to register file suffixes, it might be required
to define what actually is a file suffix and what is the set of delimiters separating them on a
particular platform. The Bind manager is born with a certain knowledge about the set of delimiters
but more can be added to provide the functionality desired. This can be done using the following
function:

<PRE>
extern void HTBind_caseSensitive	(BOOL sensitive);
</PRE>

where <EM>sensitive</EM> can either be <EM>YES</EM> or <EM>NO</EM>. Also the set of delimiters can
be defined using the following function:

<PRE>
extern CONST char *HTBind_delimiters	(void);
extern void HTBind_setDelimiters	(CONST char * new_suffixes);
</PRE>

Examples of a list of suffixes are

<PRE>
	"._"
	"."
	"._-"
</PRE>

Note that the suffixes chosen do not have to be connected with what is available on a particular
platform. However, a certain coupling will probably make maintenance of the file system easier for
all parties. In the following we will show the API for adding bindings between the preferences and
the file system. You can add a binding between a Content type and a suffix by using the following
function:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTBind_addType	(CONST char *	suffix,
				 CONST char *	format,
				 double		value);
</PRE>

Calling this with <EM>suffix</EM> set to "*" will set the default representation which is used in
case no other suffix fits the actual file. Using a suffix set to "*.*" will set the default
representation for unknown suffix files which contain a "."  The <EM>format</EM> argument is exactly
like described in the section <A HREF="Prefs.html">Request Preferences</A>. In exactly the same way
you can add a binding between an encoding anda file suffix using the following function:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTBind_addEncoding	(CONST char *	suffix,
				 CONST char *	encoding,
				 double		value);
</PRE>

Bindings can also be made between a file suffix and a specific natural language:

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTBind_addLanguage	(CONST char *	suffix,
				 CONST char *	language,
				 double		value);
</PRE>

In all cases, it should be mentioned, that any of the suffixes <EM>can</EM> contain characters that
normally must be escaped in a URL, for example space &lt; &gt;. However, they should <EM>not</EM> be
encoded when parsed as the <CODE>suffix</CODE> parameter but left as is.
