<H1>Presentation Modules</H1>

The HTML parser has three different levels of APIs in order to make
the implementation as flexible as possible.  Depending on which API is
used by the application, the output can be a stream, a structured stream
or a set of callback functions as indicated in the figure below:

<DL>

<DT>SGML Stream Interface

<DD>This interface provides the most basic API consisting of the
output from a stream without any form for structure imposed on the
data. The internal <A HREF="../../Implementation/SGML.html">SGML
parser</A> parses the data sequence, identifies SGML markup tags, and
passes the information on the the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTML.html">HTML parser</A>. However, if the
application has its own SGML parser and HTML parser, the internal
parsers can be disabled by removing the internal HTML converter called
<CODE>HTMLPresent()</CODE> used to present a graphic object on the
screen from both the global and the local list of converters and
presenters.

<DT>HTML Structured Stream Interface

<DD>If the application has its own HTML parser that understands the
structured output from the internal SGML parser then the second API
can be used. The current HTML parser in the Library is very basic and
does not understand many of the new features in HTML 2 and 3.

<DT>HText Call Back Interface

<DD>The last API can be in case the application prefers to use the
internal HTML parser and only wants to provide a platform dependent
definition of the callback functions defined in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HText.html" >HText module</A>.  Now, the
parsing is all done internally in the Library and the application is
only called with segments of fully parsed HTML. The callback functions
are all defined as prototypes in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HText.html" >HText module</A> but the
client must provide the actual code that defines the presentation
method used for a specific HTML tag.

</DL>

Due to the limited functionality of the internal HTML parsing module,
many applications have chosen to implement their own HTML
parser. Therefore many regard the HTML parser module as being an
<EM>application specific module</EM> instead of a <EM>dynamic
module</EM>. This will be alleviated in the next version of the
Library, which hopefully will ease the use of the internal HTML
parser. The current parser can be overriding as described in section
<A HREF="#override">Application Specific Modules</A>.
