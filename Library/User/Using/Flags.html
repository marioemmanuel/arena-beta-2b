<H1>Trace Messages and Preprocessor Defines</H1>

The Library has a huge amount of trace messages that are very useful when debugging an application.
In this section we will have a look at how to use the trace messages and also what preprocessor
defines that can be used to modify the behavior of the Library.

<H2>Trace Messages</H3>

The Library has a huge set of trace messages that can be enabled in various ways. They are often an
important help to the application programmer in order to debug an application and this is the reason
why they are trated in this User's Guide. <P>

<H2>Preprocessor Defines</H2>

Most of the preprocessor defines in the Library are platform dependent that are determined as a
result of the <EM>BUILD script</EM>. However, there are some few defines that on a platform
independent basis can change the default behavior of the Library.</P>

<DL>
<DT><CODE>HT_REENTRANT</CODE>
<DD>This boolean define should be enabled if the reentrant versions ("*_r") of the system calls
should be used. The name of these system calls are currently "*_r", for example
<CODE>strtok_r</CODE>. The default value is <EM>OFF</EM>.

<DT><CODE>HT_SHARED_DISK_CACHE</CODE>
<DD>If the cache can be shared between several clients this will have an effect on the way, update
of a document will be done. The default cache implementation of the cache manager does not support
this so the default value is NOT defined.

<DT><CODE>HT_DIRECT_WAIS</CODE>
<DD>This boolean define is enabled by the <EM>Makefile.include</EM> file as described in section <A
HREF="Methods.html">Access Methods</A>. The default value is <EM>OFF</EM>.

<DT><CODE>HT_DEFAULT_WAIS_GATEWAY</CODE>
<DD>A constant string value which WAIS gateway to contact if
<CODE>HT_DIRECT_WAIS</CODE> is not defined and no gateway has been
defined using environment variables

<DT><CODE>HT_FTP_NO_PORT</CODE>
<DD>The FTP module can handle both <CODE>PASV</CODE> and <CODE>PORT</CODE> when requesting a
document from a FTP server. If the application is a proxy server running on top of a firewall
machine then <CODE>PORT</CODE> is normally not allowed as a firewall does not accept incoming
connections on arbitrary ports. This define will disable the use of <CODE>PORT</CODE>. The default
value is to <EM>use</EM> <CODE>PORT</CODE> if <CODE>PASV</CODE> fails.

<DT><CODE>WWWLIB_SIG</CODE>
<DD>The Library has a very small set of signal handlers whose action most often are simply to ignore
the signals. However, due to a bug in the TCP kernel on Solaris and other SVR4 platforms returning a
SIG_PIPE signal, some kind of handling is required on these platforms, and the signal handling is
enabled by default on these platforms.

<DT><CODE>HT_TMP_ROOT</CODE>
<DD>The default destination for temporary files if no other destination has been given by the
application. Temporary files include files created for external presenters etc. The default value is
<CODE>/tmp</CODE> which obviously is not suited for large amount of data.

<DT><CODE>HT_CACHE_ROOT</CODE>
<DD>If the cache is enabled and no cache root directory has been specified then use this as the
location. The default value is again <CODE>/tmp</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>HT_NO_RULES</CODE>
<DD>If this flag is enabled then no configuration or rule file is searched for map rules when
handling a request even if a rule file has been specified by the application. The default value is
<EM>OFF</EM>

<DT><CODE>HT_NO_PROXY</CODE>
<DD>If no environment variables are to be searched for gateways or proxies for a request. The
default value is <EM>OFF</EM>
