<H1>Keeping Track of History</H1>

The Library supports client applications in keeping track of which
locations the user has visited while browsing the Web. The internal
history list is implemented in the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTHist.html">HTHist module</A>. This module
is completely autonomous as it is not used by any other modules in the
Library so if it is not referred to in the application code then it
will not be linked into the linked application. This means that if the
application does not need recording of history then no action is
required at all.<P>

The purpose of the history module is to try not to impose any
particular history mechanism policy but instead to allow various
different history mechanisms. The basic features of the history module
are:

<UL>
<LI>The module can handle multiple history lists
<LI>The underlying data model is linear lists
<LI>The module keeps a position pointer into this list
<LI>The application can refer to an element in the list by an index
</UL>

Some of the navigation steps supported by the module are "back",
"forward", and jump to a position in the list. The details of the
module is listed in the declaration part of the <A
HREF="../../Implementation/HTHist.html">HTHist module</A>.
