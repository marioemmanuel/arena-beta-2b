<H1>Request Preferences</H1>

The introductory chapter introduced converters and how they can be set up. Converters are a part or
a family of preferences in the Library that can be configured by applications and this chapter
explains in more detail how to use these features. The family of preferences includes the following
members:

<UL>
<LI>Format converters
<LI>Natural languages
<LI>Content encodings
<LI>Character sets
</UL>

As mentioned in the previous chapter, when the Library is first initialized, it knows nothing about
these preferences. By specifying preferences, the application can tailor the Library to fit the
features supported by the application and by the end user. In the following section we will describe
how the application can set up the various preferences. All preferences described in this chapter
use lists to group the sets together. As we will see later in this chapter, the reason for this is
that lists are an easy way of assigning specific preferences to various requests. <P>

<A NAME="converters"><H2>Format Converters</H2></A>

We have already seen an example on how a converter can be set up. Let's take a step back and look at
the declaration of the function that adds a converter, <CODE>HTConversion_add(...)</CODE>:

<PRE>
extern void HTConversion_add   (HTList *	conversions,
				CONST char * 	rep_in,
				CONST char * 	rep_out,
				HTConverter *	converter,
				double		quality,
				double		secs, 
				double		secs_per_byte);
</PRE>

The first argument is a <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTList.html">list object</A>. List objects are
one of the several container objects in the Library and they are explained in more details in the <A
HREF="../Guide/">W3C Library Internals</A>. All we have to know at this point is to create a list
object:

<PRE>
extern HTList *	HTList_new (void);
</PRE>

The two next arguments describes the input format and the output format of the data that is entering
and leaving the converter respectively. The syntax for these formats follow the syntax defined by
the <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP Protocol</A> and the <A
HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1521.txt">MIME specification</A> which
has a <EM>type</EM> string and a <EM>subtype</EM> string separated by a slash "/"

<PRE>
	&lt;type&gt; "/" &lt;subtype&gt;
</PRE>

Some of the most common examples are

<PRE>
	text/plain
	text/html
	image/gif
	audio/basic
	*/*
</PRE>

In addition to these "official" MIME types, the Library has a small set of internal representations
that uniquely exist within the Library. They are used to describe data formats that are not really
formats but an intermediate state of the document. The two most used formats of this type are

<PRE>
	www/present
	www/unknown
</PRE>

The internal formats are characterized by having the type <EM>www</EM> which doesn't exist anywhere
but in the Library. The first of the two subtypes shown represent the rendered document as presented
to the user and the second subtype represents an unknown data format. <P>

The <CODE>converter</CODE> argument is a pointer to the function that is to be called in order to
create a converter object capable of handling the conversion from the input type to the output
type. By registering a pointer pointing to the converter, the converter can be set up dynamically.
This allows the Library to evaluate the set of registered converters each time a conversion is
requested and then chose the best suitable converter on the fly. <P>

The next argument is the <EM>quality factor</EM> which we will describe in a separate paragraph
later in this chapter. The last two arguments are not currently used but are reserved for future
use. For now, using a value of 0 is perfectly valid. <P>

Converters are intended to be used when we have our own module to handle the data coming from the
remote server. The module can either be one provided by the Library or one made by the
application. However, in some cases we would rather hand off the data to an external application for
presenting the data. Often external applications are viewers of some sort, for example a postscript
viewer or a mpeg viewer. The Library lets us register external applications as <EM>presenters</EM>
very much like converters. This will become obvious if we take a look at how we register presenters:

<PRE>
extern void HTPresentation_add (HTList *	conversions,
				CONST char * 	representation,
				CONST char * 	command,
				CONST char * 	test_command,
				double		quality,
				double		secs, 
				double		secs_per_byte);
</PRE>

As was the case with converters, the first argument is a list which we create in exactly the same
way as shown before. Presenters only need a input format as we hand off the data to the external
application and never sees it again. A special thing about presenters and converters is that as they
are very similar they are also treated very much alike internally in the Library. Therefore a list
object can contain both converters and presenters at the same time. This makes often the management
easier for the application instead of having to deal with two separate lists.<P>

The next field is reserved to be used in connection with mail cap parsers as the <EM>test field</EM>
of a mail cap file. The Library does not yet directly support <A
HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1524.txt">Mail Cap files</A> but the
registration of presenters is foreseen to be able to work with mail cap files. The <A
HREF="../../../Arena/">Arena browser</A> is an example of an application having its own Mail Cap
file parser while using the Library. The description of the test field in <A
HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1524.txt">RFC 1524</A> is included
below: <P>

<EM>The "test" field may be used to test some external condition (e.g., the machine architecture, or
the window system in use) to determine whether or not the mail cap line applies. It specifies a
program to be run to test some condition. The semantics of execution and of the value returned by
the test program are operating system dependent, with UNIX semantics specified in Appendix A. If the
test fails, a subsequent mail cap entry should be sought. Multiple test fields are not permitted --
since a test can call a program, it can already be arbitrarily complex.  </EM> <P>

The last three arguments are exactly identical to the conversion registration so there is no need to
describe them any more here. Again, the quality factor will be described in details later in this
chapter.<P>

<H2>Natural Languages</H2>

The preferred natural language or languages is in almost all situations dependent on the individual
user and an application should therefore give the user the opportunity to change the setup. When
specifying a natural language preference, the Library will send this preference along with all HTTP
requests. The remote server will then (it if supports this feature) look for a version in the
language or languages mentioned. If it finds a matching document then it returns this one, otherwise
it uses the best alternative. If no language is specified the remote server may whatever version it
finds. You can add an element to the list of natural languages by using the following function:

<PRE>
extern void HTLanguage_add (HTList *		list,
			    CONST char *	lang,
			    double		quality);
</PRE>

The list object containing the set of natural languages is similar to the list elements containing
the converters and the presenters. However, in contrast to the former two which actually can be one
list, the list of natural languages must be a list on its own. <P>

The semantics of the language argument follows closely the <EM>Language</EM> tag of the <A
HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP protocol</A> which in terms is based on the <A
HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1766.txt">RFC 1766</A>. Some example
tags are

<PRE>
	en
	en-US
	en-cockney
	i-cherokee
	x-pig-latin
</PRE>

where any two-letter primary tag is n <A HREF="http://www.iso.ch">ISO</A> 639 language abbreviation
and any two-letter initial subtag in an ISO 3166 country code.

<H2>Content Encodings</H2>

Some documents are not send in their original data obejct but is encoded in some way. On the Web
this is mostly some kind of compression but other encodings for example base 64 can be encountered
when talking to NNTP servers etc. Just as for the other preferences, an application can register a
supported encoders or decodes as a list. Encoders and decoders are registered in the same way with
no differentiation whether it is a encoder or a decoder:

<PRE>
extern void HTEncoding_add (HTList * 		list,
			    CONST char *	encoding,
			    double		quality);
</PRE>

The list argument is the now well-known way of handling these preferences and we will see this many
more times throughout the guide. The "encoding" argument is a constant string just like the data
format descriptions in the registration of converters and presenters. The values are also inspired
strongly by the <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP Protocol</A> and the <A
HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1521.txt">MIME specification</A> and
some of the most common examples are:

<PRE>
	base64
	compress
	gzip
</PRE>

As the list of natural languages, the list of encoders and decoder must be a separate list.

<H2>Character Sets</H2>

As the Web reaches all parts of the Internet there are more and more documents written in languages
which contains characters not included in the ISO-8859-1 character set. A consequence of this the
set of characters sets is often tightly connected with the natural language. The Library does not
directly support other character sets but in case an application is capable of handling alternative
sets it can register these as preferred character sets along with a quality factor just as all the
other preferences in this section.

<PRE>
extern void HTCharset_add (HTList *		list,
			   CONST char *		charset,
			   double		quality);
</PRE>

Also the <EM>charset</EM> argument is inspired by the <A HREF="../../../Protocols/">HTTP
Protocol</A> and the <A HREF="http://info.internet.isi.edu:80/in-notes/rfc/files/rfc1521.txt">MIME
specification</A>. Some of the most common examples of the charset parameter is:

<PRE>
	US-ASCII
	ISO-8859-1
	UNICODE-1-1
</PRE>

Again, the list of preferred character sets must be a separate list.

<H2>The Quality Factor</H2>

Characteristic for all the preferences above is that there is a quality factor associated with each
member. The quality factor is a real number between 0 and 1 with 0 meaning "very bad" and 1 means
"perfect". By registering a natural language or any or other preference in this group together with
a quality factor you can specify "how well the preference is handled" either by the application or
by the user. In the case of the user the quality factor of a natural language is how well the user
understands the language. In my case, the quality factors for, for example Greek would be close to
zero and 1 for Danish (nothing bad said about Greek!). <P>

It is a bit different for converters where it is often the application's ability of handling the
data format rather than the user's perception. As an example it is often faster to use a converter
than a presenter as it takes time to launch the external application and the Library can not use
progressive display mechanisms which is often the case for converters. Therefore, as an example, if
we capable of handling an image in <EM>png</EM> format inline but rely on an external viewer for
presenting postscript, we might set up the following list:

<PRE>
HTConversion_add (converters, "image/gif", "www/present", GifPresenter, <B>1.0</B>, 0.0, 0.0);

HTPresentation_add (presenters, "application/postscript", "ghostview %s", NULL, <B>0.5</B>, 0.0, 0.0);
</PRE>

where the gif converter is registered with a quality factor of <B>1.0</B> and the postscript
presenter with a quality factor of <B>0.5</B>.

<H2>Enabling Preferences</H2>

All we have done until now is to show how we can register sets of preferences. However, we still
need to define where and when to actually let the Library use the preferences. This can be done in
two ways: Globally or locally. When assigning a set of preferences, for example the set of natural
languages, it can either be assigned to <EM>all</EM> future requests (globally) or to a specific
request (locally). The preferences can also partly be assigned globally and partly locally so that
the most common preferences are registered globally and only some preferences specific to a single
request is then added by registering the sets locally. <P>

Here we will only show how to enable the preferences globally. Later when we have discussed how to
create a request object we will see how to enable the preferences locally and also if they are to
be added to the global list or completely override the global list for a particular request.

<H3>Converters and Presenters</H3>

<PRE>
extern void HTFormat_setConversion	(HTList *list);
extern HTList * HTFormat_conversion	(void);
</PRE>

<H3>Content Encodings</H3>

<PRE>
extern void HTFormat_setEncoding	(HTList *list);
extern HTList * HTFormat_encoding	(void);
</PRE>

<H3>Content Encodings</H3>

<PRE>
extern void HTFormat_setLanguage	(HTList *list);
extern HTList * HTFormat_language	(void);
</PRE>

<H3>Character Sets</H3>

<PRE>
extern void HTFormat_setCharset		(HTList *list);
extern HTList * HTFormat_charset	(void);
</PRE>

<H2>Cleaning up Preferences</H2>

As the application is responsible for setting up the sets of preferences, it is also responsible for
deleting them once they are not needed anymore, for example when the application i s closing down,
or the user has changed them. The Library provides two mechanisms for cleaning up old lists: It can
either be done by invoking separate methods on each set of preferences, or it can be done in a batch
of all globally registered preferences or all locally registered preferences relative to a single
request. In this context, a batch is the total set of registered converters, encoder, charsets, and
languages. Here we will only show how to cleanup preferences set-wise and as a globally batch of
preferences. We leave the local cleanup until we have described the request object later in this
guide. <P>

Common for the cleanup methods is that when they have been called you can nor more use the lists as
they are not pointing to valid places in the memory. The first mechanism for cleaning up lists is by
calling the cleanup method of each preference as indicated below:

<H3>Converters</H3>

<PRE>
extern void HTConversion_deleteAll	(HTList * list);
</PRE>

<H3>Presenters</H3>

<PRE>
extern void HTPresentation_deleteAll	(HTList * list);
</PRE>

<H3>Content Encodings</H3>

<PRE>
extern void HTEncoding_deleteAll	(HTList * list);
</PRE>

<H3>Content Languages</H3>

<PRE>
extern void HTLanguage_deleteAll	(HTList * list);
</PRE>

<H3>Character Sets</H3>

<PRE>
extern void HTCharset_deleteAll		(HTList * list);
</PRE>

The second mechanism which at once cleans up all globally registered preferences can often be used
in order to simplify the management done by the application. Note, however, that all globally lists
become inaccessible for future reference. In you want to define new sets of preferences then you
need to start all over again and create a new list object.

<PRE>
extern void HTFormat_deleteAll		(void);
</PRE>

<H2>Getting Help on Initialization Converters and Presenters</H2>

The Library has a special module called <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTInit.html">HTInit</A> which
helps the application doing the initialization of all the converters and other preferences supported
internally by the Library. This module is not called directly from the Library and must explicitly
be invoked by the application. <A HREF="../../Implementation/HTInit.html">HTInit</A> is a part of
the <A HREF="../../Implementation/WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A> include file described in the previous
section, so if you include this in your application then you have direct access to the following
functions:

The following function initializes all the converters supported natively by modules in the Library
distribution file:

<PRE>
extern void HTConverterInit	(HTList * conversions);
</PRE>

There is a similar function for registering a common set of presenters that can be found on many
(especially Unix) platforms:

<PRE>
extern void HTPresenterInit	(HTList * conversions);
</PRE>

In order to show the similarity between how converters and presenters are handled in the Library,
there is also a single function that does the work of the two previous functions at once:

<PRE>
extern void HTFormatInit	(HTList * conversions);
</PRE>

<H2>Summary</H2>

We have now seen how to enable multiple sets of preferences using a very similar naming scheme and
registration process. As mentioned in the beginning, lists are easy to handle when the preferences
are likely to be changed often as the application is executed. In the next section, we will take a
look at a slightly different registration mechanism which is more suited for topics that only rarely
are registered multiple times during the execution of an application.
