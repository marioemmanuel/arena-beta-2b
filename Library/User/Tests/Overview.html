</H1><H1>Conformance and Performance Testing
</H1><P>One of the important design goals of the W3C Reference Library is
that it must conform to the current specifications of the Web model, for
example for HTTP. &nbsp;This page gives an overview of what tests we have
available and what we are working on. We have divided the tests the following
four categories:
<DL><DT><B>Basic core test suite</B>

<DD>In order to make sure that the basic parts of the Libray conforms to
the current specifications, we have developed a set of basic tools.
<DT><B>Stress and Regresion tests 
</B>
<DD>It is important to test the Library code under stress - that is - in
an environment with limited
resources. This can for example be the number of available socket descriptors,
lack of virtual
memory, disk space etc. We have a set of example applications that can serve
to do the stress testing:

<UL><LI><A HREF=/afs/w3.org/team/WWW/MiniServ/>Mini server and proxy</A>
<LI><A HREF=/afs/w3.org/team/WWW/Robot/>Robot</A>
<LI><A HREF=/afs/w3.org/team/WWW/ComLine/>Command line tool</A>
<LI><A HREF=/afs/w3.org/team/WWW/LineMode/>Line mode browser</A>
</UL><P>The test should also include testing of a well-known test base where
we can perform regression tests
on.

<DT><B>Performance testing</B>
<DD>Even though performance is not the most important factor in the W3C reference
code, we need to
be aware of the problem as demos only work in practice if they run reasonaly
smooth. We have <A HREF="Prof_1.html">some first results</A> available and
more will come.
<DT><B>Platform dependent testing
</B>
<DD>We should select a small set of main platforms for tesing platform
dependencies. In all other
cases we should rely on external help for doing the test.
