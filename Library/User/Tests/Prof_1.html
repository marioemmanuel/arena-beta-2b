</H1><H1>Conformance and Performance Testing
</H1><P>One of the important design goals of the W3C Reference Library is
that it must conform to the current specifications of the Web model, for
example for HTTP. &nbsp;This page gives an overview of what tests we have
available and what we are working on. We have divided the tests the following
four categories:
<DL><DT><B>Basic core test suite</B>

<DD>In order to make sure that the basic parts of the Libray conforms to
the current specifications, we have developed a set of basic tools.
<DT><B>Stress and Regresion tests 
</B>
<DD>It is important to test the Library code under stress - that is - in
an environment with limited
resources. This can for example be the number of available socket descriptors,
lack of virtual
memory, disk space etc. We have a set of example applications that can serve
to do the stress testing:

<UL><LI><A HREF=/afs/w3.org/team/WWW/MiniServ/>Mini server and proxy</A>
<LI><A HREF=/afs/w3.org/team/WWW/Robot/>Robot</A>
<LI><A HREF=/afs/w3.org/team/WWW/ComLine/>Command line tool</A>
<LI><A HREF=/afs/w3.org/team/WWW/LineMode/>Line mode browser</A>
</UL><P>The test should also include testing of a well-known test base where
we can perform regression tests
on.

<DT><B>Performance testing</B>
<DD>Even though performance is not the most important factor in the W3C reference
code, we need to
be aware of the problem as demos only work in practice if they run reasonaly
smooth. We have some first results available and more will come.
<DT><B>Platform dependent testing
</B>
<DD>We should select a small set of main platforms for tesing platform
dependencies. In all other
cases we should rely on external help for doing the test.

Performance Testing
<P>-------------------
<P>
<P>The test run contained GET methods in first generation (181 requests)
and HEAD 
<P>(121 requests) methods in second generation links from this page. The
total 
<P>amount of requests issued was 302. The results are shown below with the
robot 
<P>running on www23 (solaris 2.4)
<P>
<P>Without proxy:
<P>
<P>Robot started on Sat, 10 Feb 1996 15:48:46
<P>Robot terminated Sat, 10 Feb 1996 15:49:27
<P>total: 41 sec (7.3 request/sec)
<P>
<P>With mini proxy running on www20 (solaris 2.3):
<P>
<P>Robot started on Sat, 10 Feb 1996 16:13:54
<P>Robot terminated Sat, 10 Feb 1996 16:14:36
<P>total: 42 sec which gives a proxy overhead of 1 sec or 2.4%
<P>
<P>With CERN proxy and a minimum configuration on www20:
<P>
<P>Robot started on Sat, 10 Feb 1996 16:18:48
<P>Robot terminated Sat, 10 Feb 1996 16:20:00
<P>run 1: total: 72 sec which gives a proxy overhead of 31 sec or 75.6%
<P>run 2: total: 71 sec which gives a proxy overhead of 30 sec or 73.1%
<P>
<P>With mini proxy running on zorch (alpha):
<P>
<P>Robot started on Sat, 10 Feb 1996 15:52:25
<P>Robot terminated Sat, 10 Feb 1996 15:53:06
<P>total: 41 sec which gives a proxy overhead of 0 sec ???
<P>
<P>This of course doesn't show a lot as we need more statistics in order
to take 
<P>the variance into account. However, the purpose was to get a grib on if
it 
<P>made sense for me to continue working on integrating ILU into libwww for

<P>making a testbed for HTTP-NG. I think this looks promising and I have
done 
<P>some first attempts on the merging of ILU and libwww but don't have any

<P>results yet.
<P>
<P>Robot Profiling
<P>---------------
<P>
<P>It's is interesting to see that more than 66% of all cycles are used in
the 
<P>SGML/HTML parser alone, and that doesn't include any presentation - only

<P>parsing. The Event loop does not seem to be a problem even though it consumes

<P>a lot of cycles on context swapping and the select call itself. Also,
our new 
<P>dynamic memory handler does not provide significant overhead. There is
some 
<P>information about the memory handler at
<P>
<P>	http://www.w3.org/devel/WWW/Library/User/Using/Memory.html

<P>Server Profiling
<P>----------------
<P>
<P>The server does not include the SGML/HTML parser at all and hence the

<P>profiling test looks very different. Here the event loop takes a significant

<P>amount of time, the reason beeing that the event loop is optimized for
user 
<P>applications and not server applications. The solution is to provide multiple

<P>event loops that are optimized for various purposes. Not surprising, a

<P>considerable part of the time is spent in the MIME parser.
