The MIME parser stream presents a MIME document. It recursively
invokes the format manager to handle embedded formats.<P>

As well as stripping off and parsing the headers, the MIME parser has
to parse any weirld MIME encodings it may meet within the body parts
of messages, and must deal with multipart messages. <P>

This module is implemented to the level necessary for operation with
WWW, but is not currently complete for any arbitrary MIME message.<P>

Check the <A NAME="z0" HREF="HTMIME.c">source</A> for latest additions
to functionality.<P> The MIME parser is complicated by the fact that
WWW allows real binary to be sent, not ASCII encoded.  Therefore the
netascii decoding is included in this module. One cannot layer it by
converting first from Net to local text, then decoding it. Of course,
for local files, the net ascii decoding is not needed.  There are
therefore two creation routines. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTMIME.c">HTMIME.c</A>, and it is
a part of the <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/">
W3C Reference Library</A>.

<H2>Stream Converters in this Module</H2>

<H3>MIME header parser stream</H3>

This stream parses a complete MIME header and if a content type header
is found then the stream stack is called. Any left over data is pumped
right through the stream.

<PRE>
extern HTConverter HTMIMEConvert;
</PRE>

<H3>MIME header ONLY parser stream</H3>

This stream parses a complete MIME header and then returnes HT_PAUSE.
It does not set up any streams and resting data stays in the buffer.
This can be used if you only want to parse the headers before you
decide what to do next. This is for example the case in a server app.
