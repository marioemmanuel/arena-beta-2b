<H1>Application Stuff</H1>

This module provides some "make life easier" functions in order to get
the application going. The functionality of this module was originally
in <A HREF="HTAccess.html">HTAccess</A>, but now it has been moved
here as a part of the <A HREF="WWWApp.html">application interface</A>
where the application <EM>may</EM> use it if desired.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTHome.c">HTHome.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>. <P>

#define HTHOME_H

<A NAME="Addresses"><H2>Default WWW Addresses</H2></A>

These control the home page selection. To mess with these for normal
browses is asking for user confusion.

<PRE>
#define LOGICAL_DEFAULT "WWW_HOME"	      /* Defined to be the home page */

#ifndef PERSONAL_DEFAULT
#define PERSONAL_DEFAULT "WWW/default.html"		/* in home directory */
#endif

/* If the home page isn't found, use this file: */
#ifndef LAST_RESORT
#define LAST_RESORT	"http://www.w3.org/"
#endif

/* If one telnets to an access point it will look in this file for home page */
#ifndef REMOTE_POINTER
#define REMOTE_POINTER  "/etc/www-remote.url"		    /* can't be file */
#endif

/* and if that fails it will use this. */
#ifndef REMOTE_ADDRESS
#define REMOTE_ADDRESS  "http://www.w3.org/"		    /* can't be file */
#endif

#ifndef LOCAL_DEFAULT_FILE
#define LOCAL_DEFAULT_FILE "/usr/local/lib/WWW/default.html"

<H2>Home Anchor Generation</H2>

We provide two small functions for finding the first anchor.

<H3>Generate the Anchor for the Home Page</H4>

As it involves file access, this should only be done once when the
program first runs. This is a default algorithm using the
<CODE>WWW_HOME</CODE> environment variable.

<PRE>
extern HTParentAnchor * HTHomeAnchor (void);
</PRE>

<H3>Find Related Name</H3>

Creates a local file URI that can be used as a relative name when
calling HTParse() to expand a relative file name to an absolute
one. The code for this routine originates from the Line Mode Browser
and was moved here by <EM>howcome@w3.org</EM> in order for all clients
to take advantage.<P>

<PRE>
extern char *  HTFindRelatedName (void);
</PRE>

<H2>Net Manager Callback Functions</H2>

These two functions are examples of callback functions from the <A
HREF="HTNet.html">Net Manager</A> which are called <EM>before</EM> and
<EM>after</EM> a request respectively. They do a lot of the stuff an
application often has to do anyway.

<H3>BEFORE Request Callback</H3>

This function uses all the functionaly that the app part of the
Library gives for URL translations BEFORE a request is isseued.  It
checks for Cache, proxy, and gateway (in that order)

<PRE>
extern int HTLoadStart (HTRequest * request, int status);
</PRE>

<H3>AFTER Request Callback</H3>

This function uses all the functionaly that the app part of the Library
gives for handling AFTER a request.

<PRE>
extern int HTLoadTerminate (HTRequest * request, int status);
</PRE>

#endif /* HTHOME_H */
