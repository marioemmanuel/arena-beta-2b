This version of the stream object just writes to a socket. The socket
is assumed open and closed afterward.There are two versions (identical
on ASCII machines) one of which converts to ASCII on output. We have
to have the Net Manager involved as we want to have control of how
many sockets we are using simultanously. This means that applications
should use the <A HREF="HTFWrite.html">ANSI C FILE writer stream</A>
for writing to an output. Proxy servers will have to go through the
Net Manager anyway, so this will not be a problem for them.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTWriter.c">HTWriter.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>. <P>

<H2>Unbuffered output</H2>

This is a non-buffered output stream which remembers state using the
write_pointer. As normally we have a big buffer somewhere else in the
stream chain an extra output buffer will often not be needed. There is
also a small buffer stream that can be used if this is not the case.

<PRE>
extern HTStream * HTWriter_new (HTNet *net, BOOL leave_open);

<H2>Buffered Output</H2>

This is a buffer output stream writing to a socket. However, it uses a
"one-time" buffer in that you can specify the total amount of bytes to
be buffered. From that point it goes into transparent mode. If
buf_size > 0 then we set up buffered output used for at most buf_size
bytes. Otherwise we'll use nonbuffered output.

<PRE>
extern HTStream * HTBufWriter_new (HTNet *net, BOOL leave_open, int buf_size);
</PRE>

<H2>ASCII Stream Converter</H2>

If you are on a non-ASCII machine then this stream converts to ASCII
before data is written to the socket.

<PRE>
#ifdef NOT_ASCII
extern HTStream * HTASCIIWriter (HTNet *net, BOOL leave_open);
#endif
