<H3>Cache Manager</H3>

Caching is a required part of any efficient Internet access
applications as it saves bandwidth and improves access performance
significantly in almost all types of accesses.  The Library supports
two different types of cache: The memory cache and the file cache. The
two types differ in several ways which reflects their two main
purposes: The memory cache is for short term storage of graphic
objects whereas the file cache is for intermediate term storage of
data objects. Often it is desirable to have both a memory and a file
version of a cached document, so the two types do not exclude each
other. <P>

The cache contains details of temporary disk files which contain the
contents of remote documents.  There is also a <A
HREF="HTAnchor.html#z1">list of cache items for each URL</A> in its
anchor object. <P>

There are various ways of handling Expires header when met in a
history list. Either it can be ignored all together, the user can be
notified with a warning, or the document can be reloaded
automatically. This flag decides what action to be taken. The default
action is HT_EXPIRES_IGNORE. In HT_EXPIRES_NOTIFY mode you can specify
a message to tell the user (NULL is valid in which case my own message
pops up - watch out it might be in Danish ;-)) <P>

The Library has two notions of a local cache: a file cache and a
memory cache. The memory cache is handled by the client and the file
cache is handled by the Library. Often the format of a object cached
in memory is in the form of a hypertext object ready to be displayed
(that is, it's already parsed).
