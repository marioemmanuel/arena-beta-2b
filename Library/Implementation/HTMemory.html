<H1>Dynamic Memory Interface</H1>

</PRE>

This module implements a dynamic memory API thata is used in the
Library. There are three situations that are covered by this module:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#d">Handling of allocation and deallocation of dynamic memory</A>
<LI><A HREF="#r">Recovering from temporary lack of available memory</A>
<LI><A HREF="#p">Panic handling in case a new allocation fails</A>
</UL>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTMemory.c">HTMemory.c</A>, and it
is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>.

<PRE>
#ifndef HTMEMORY_H
#define HTMEMORY_H
</PRE>

<A NAME="d"><H2>Dynamic Memory Allocation and Deallocation</H2></A>

These are the functions for handling dynamic allocation and deallcation.

<PRE>
extern void* HTMemory_malloc(size_t size);
extern void* HTMemory_calloc(size_t count, size_t size);
extern void* HTMemory_realloc(void * ptr, size_t size);
extern void HTMemory_free(void* ptr);
</PRE>

<H3>Memory Macros</H3>

We use the following set of macros throughout the code. If you don't
wany any memory management beyond normal malloc and alloc then you can
just use that instead of the HTMemory_* function.

<PRE>
#ifndef __FILE__
#define __FILE__ ""
#endif

#ifndef __LINE__
#define __LINE__ 0L
#endif

#define HT_MALLOC(size)		HTMemory_malloc(size)
#define HT_CALLOC(count, size)	HTMemory_calloc(count, size)
#define HT_REALLOC(ptr, size)	HTMemory_realloc(ptr, size)
#define HT_FREE(pointer)	{HTMemory_free(pointer);(pointer)=NULL;}
</PRE>

<A NAME="r"><H2>Memory Freer Functions</H2></A>

The dynamic memory freer functions are typically functions that are
capable of freeing large chunks of memory. In case a new allocation
fails, the allocation method looks for any freer functions to
call. There can be multriple freer functions and after each call, the
allocation method tries again to allocate the desired amount of
dynamic memory. The freer functions are called in <EM>reverse</EM>
order meaning that the <EM>last</EM> one registered gets called
<EM>first</EM>. That way, it is easy to add temporary free functions
which then are guaranteed to be called first if a methods fails.

<H3>Add a Freer Function</H3>

You can add a freer function by using the following method. The
Library itself registeres a set of free functions during
initialization. If the application does not register any freer
functions then the Library looks how it can free internal memory.

<PRE>
typedef void HTMemoryCallback(size_t size);

extern BOOL HTMemoryCall_add (HTMemoryCallback * cbf);
</PRE>

<H3>Delete a Freer Function</H3>

Freer functions can be deleted at any time in which case they are not
called anymore.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTMemoryCall_delete (HTMemoryCallback * cbf);
extern BOOL HTMemoryCall_deleteAll (void);
</PRE>

<A NAME="p"><H2>Panic Handling</H2></A>

If the freer functions are not capable of deallocation enough memory
then the application must have an organized way of closing down. This
is done using the panic handler. In the libwww, each allocation is 
tested and HT_OUTOFMEM is called if a NULL was returned. HT_OUTOFMEM
is a macro which calls HTMemory_outofmem. This function calls an exit
function defined by the app in a call to HTMemory_setExit. If the app
has not defined this function, HTMemory_outofmem TTYPrints the error
message and calls exit(1).

<PRE>
typedef void HTMemory_exitCallback(char *name, char *file, unsigned long line);

extern void HTMemory_setExit(HTMemory_exitCallback * pExit);
extern HTMemory_exitCallback * HTMemory_exit(void);
</PRE>

<H3>Call the Exit Handler</H3>

If an allocation fails then this function is called. If the
application has registered it's own panic handler then this is called
diretly from this function. Otherwise, the default behavior is to
write a small message to stderr and then exit.

<PRE>
#define outofmem(file, name)	HT_OUTOFMEM(name)
#define HT_OUTOFMEM(name)	HTMemory_outofmem((name), __FILE__, __LINE__)

extern void HTMemory_outofmem(char * name, char * file, unsigned long line);
</PRE>

<PRE>
#endif /* HTMEMORY_H */
