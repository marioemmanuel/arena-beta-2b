In addition top the basic W3C Reference Library include file called <A
HREF="WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> you <EM>can</EM> also include this
file depending on the needs of your application. However, it is not
required and none of the files included below are ever used in the
core part of the Library itself. Only if this file is included, the
extra modules will get included in the linked object code. It is also
possible to include only a subset of the files below if the
functionality you are after is covered by them.

<H3>Rule File Management</H3>

Another way to initialize applications is to use a rule file, also
known as a configuration file. This is for example the case with the
W3C httpd and the W3C Line Mode Browser. This module provides basic
support for configuration file management and the application can use
this is desired. The module is not referred to by the Library. Reading
a rule file is implemented as a stream converter so that a rule file
can come from anywhere, even across the network!

<H3>Proxies and Gateways</H3>

Applications do not have to provide native support for all protocols,
they can in many situations rely on the support of proxies and
gateways to help doing the job. Proxy servers are often used to carry
client requests through a firewall where they can provide services
like corporate caching and other network optimizations. Both Proxy
servers and gateways can serve as "protocol translators" which can
convert a request in the main Web protocol, HTTP, to an equivalent
request in another protocol, for example NNTP, FTP, or Gopher. In case
a proxy server or a gateway is available to the application, it can
therefore by use of HTTP forward all requests to for example a proxy
server which then handle the communications with the remote server,
for example using FTP about the document and return it to the
application (proxy client) using HTTP.
