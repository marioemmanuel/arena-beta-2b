This stream also buffers the result to find out the content length.
If a maximum buffer limit is reached Content-Length is calculated for
logs but it is not sent to the client -- rather the buffer is flushed
right away. Code taken from HTRequest.c written by Ari Luotonen and
modified to fit new stream model. The buffer stream is a small buffer
that can be used to optimize net work access in order to prevent
multiple writes. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTNetTxt.c">HTNetTxt.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>.
