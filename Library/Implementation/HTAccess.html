This module is the application interface module to the <A
HREF="HTReq.html">Request Manager</A>. You can use the Request Manager
directly but this module makes it easier to use by providing a lot of
small request functions using the Request Manager in different
ways. It contains help functions for accessing documents and for
uploading documents to a remote server.<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTAccess.c">HTAccess.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>. <P>

<A NAME="Library"><H2>Generic Library Functions</H2></A>

These are functions that affect the overall behavior of the Library.

<H3><IMG SRC="../../Icons/32x32/warning.gif"> Initializing and
Terminating the Library</H3>

These two functions initiates memory and settings for the Library and
cleans up memory kept by the Library when about to exit the
application. They <B>must</B> be used!

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLibInit (CONST char * AppName, CONST char * AppVersion);
extern BOOL HTLibTerminate (void);
</PRE>

<H3>Library Name and Version</H3>

You can get the generic name of the Library and the version by using
the following functions:

<PRE>
extern CONST char * HTLib_name (void);
extern CONST char * HTLib_version (void);
</PRE>

<H3>Application Name and Version</H3>

Returns the name of the application and the version number that was
passed to the <CODE>HTLibInit()</CODE> function.

<PRE>
extern CONST char * HTLib_appName (void);
extern CONST char * HTLib_appVersion (void);
</PRE>

<H3>Accessing the Local File System</H3>

The Library does normally use the local file system for dumping
unknown data objects, file cache etc. In some situations this is not
desired and we can therefore turn it off. This mode also prevents you
from being able to access other resources where you have to log in, fr
example telnet.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLib_secure (void);
extern void HTLib_setSecure (BOOL mode);
</PRE>

<A NAME="LoadDoc"><H2>LOAD Request Methods</H2></A>

<H3>Request a document from absolute name</H3>

Request a document referencd by an absolute URL.  Returns YES if
request accepted, else NO

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoadAbsolute (CONST char * url, HTRequest* request);
</PRE>

<H3>Request a document from absolute name to stream</H3>

Request a document referencd by an absolute URL and sending the data
down a stream. This is _excactly_ the same as HTLoadAbsolute as the
ourputstream is specified using the function.
HTRequest_setOutputStream(). 'filter' is ignored!  Returns YES if
request accepted, else NO

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoadToStream (CONST char * url, BOOL filter, HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H3>Request a document from relative name</H3>

Request a document referenced by a relative URL. The relative URL is
made absolute by resolving it relative to the address of the 'base'
anchor. Returns YES if request accepted, else NO

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoadRelative (CONST char * 	relative,
			    HTParentAnchor *	base,
			    HTRequest *		request);
</PRE>

<H3>Request an anchor</H3>

Request the document referenced by the anchor Returns YES if request
accepted, else NO

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoadAnchor (HTAnchor * anchor, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<H3>Request an anchor</H3>

Same as HTLoadAnchor but any information in the Error Stack in the
request object is kept, so that any error messages in one This
function is almost identical to HTLoadAnchor, but it doesn't clear the
error stack so that the information in there is kept.  Returns YES if
request accepted, else NO

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoadAnchorRecursive (HTAnchor * anchor, HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<H3>Search an Anchor</H3>

Performs a keyword search on word given by the user. Adds the keyword
to the end of the current address and attempts to open the new
address.  The list of keywords must be a space-separated list and
spaces will be converted to '+' before the request is issued.  Search
can also be performed by HTLoadAbsolute() etc.  Returns YES if request
accepted, else NO

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTSearch (CONST char *	keywords,
		      HTParentAnchor *  base,
		      HTRequest * 	request);
</PRE>

<H3>Search a document from absolute name</H3>

Request a document referencd by an absolute URL appended with the
keywords given. The URL can NOT contain any fragment identifier!  The
list of keywords must be a space-separated list and spaces will be
converted to '+' before the request is issued.  Returns YES if request
accepted, else NO

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTSearchAbsolute (CONST char *	keywords,
			      CONST char *	url,
			      HTRequest *	request);
</PRE>

<A NAME="PostDoc"><H2>POST Request Methods</H2></A>

<H3>Copy an anchor</H3>

Fetch the URL from either local file store <B>or</B> from a remote
HTTP server and send it using either PUT or POST to the remote
destination using HTTP. The caller can decide the exact method used
and which HTTP header fields to transmit by setting the user fields in
the request structure.  If posting to NNTP then we can't dispatch at
this level but must pass the source anchor to the news module that
then takes all the refs to NNTP and puts into the "newsgroups" header
Returns YES if request accepted, else NO

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTCopyAnchor (HTAnchor * src_anchor, HTRequest * main_req);
</PRE>

<H3>Upload an Anchor</H3>

This function can be used to send data along with a request to a
remote server. It can for example be used to POST form data to a
remote HTTP server - or it can be used to post a newsletter to a NNTP
server. In either case, you pass a callback function which the request
calls when the remote destination is ready to accept data. In this
callback you get the current request object and a stream into where
you can write data. It is very important that you return the value
returned by this stream to the Library so that it knows what to do
next. The reason is that the outgoing stream might block or an error
may occur and in that case the Library must know about it. If you do
not want to handle the stream interface yourself then you can use the
<CODE>HTUpload_callback</CODE> which is declared below.<P>

The source anchor represents the data object in memory and it points
to the destination anchor by using the <A
HREF="../User/Architecture/PostWeb.html">POSTWeb method</A>. The
source anchor contains metainformation about the data object in memory
and the destination anchor represents the reponse from the remote
server.  Returns YES if request accepted, else NO

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTUploadAnchor (HTAnchor *		source_anchor,
			    HTRequest * 	request,
			    HTPostCallback *	callback);
</PRE>

<H3>POST Callback Handler</H3>

Is you do not want to handle the stream interface on your own, you can
use this "middleman" function which does the actual writing to the
target stream for the anchor upload and also handles the return value
from the stream. Now, your application is called via the callback
function that you may associate with a request object. You indicate
when you have sent all the data you want by returning HT_LOADED from
the callback.

<PRE>
PUBLIC int HTUpload_callback (HTRequest * request, HTStream * target);
