This interface provides functionality for guessing unknown media types
from magic words. The stream is a one that reads first a chunk of
stuff, tries to figure out the format, and calls
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. This is a kind of lazy-evaluation of
<CODE>HTStreamStack()</CODE>. <P>

This could be extended arbitrarily to recognize all the possible
file formats in the world, if someone only had time to do it. <P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTGuess.c">HTGuess.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>.
