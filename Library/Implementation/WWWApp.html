<H1>Non-Mandatory Application Include File</H1>

<PRE>
/*

</PRE>

In addition top the basic W3C Reference Library include file called <A
HREF="WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> you <EM>can</EM> also include this
file called WWWApp.h depending on the needs of your
application. However, it is not required and none of the files
included below are ever used in the core part of the Library
itself. Only if this file is included, the extra modules will get
included in the linked object code. It is also possible to include
only a subset of the files below if the functionality you are after is
covered by them.

<H2>Generating the First Anchor</H2>

This module provides some "make life easier" functions in order to get
the application going. They help you generate the first anchor, also
called the <EM>home anchor</EM>. It also contains a nice set of
default WWW addresses.

<H2>User Dialogs and Messages</H2>

You can register a set of callback functions to handle user prompting,
error messages, confimations etc. Here we give a set of functions that
can be used on almost anu thinkable platform. If you want to provide
your own platform dependent implementation then fine :-)

<H2>After Terminating a Request</H2>

When a request is terminated, the application often has to do some
action as a result of the request (and of the result of the
request). The Application part of the Library provides two following
modules to handle <EM>logging</EM> and <EM>history
management</EM>. You can register a <EM>POST request handler</EM> in
the <A HREF="HTNet.html">Net Manager</A> as described in the <A
HREF="../User/Using/Overview.html">User's Guide</A>. <P>

You can find a function called <CODE>HTLoadTerminate</CODE> in the <A
HREF="HTHome.html">HTHome module</A> that enables all the functionality
for handling a request result.

<H3>Logging</H3>

Often it is required to log the requests issued to the Library. This
can either be the case if the application is a server or it can also
be useful in a client application. This module provides a simple
logging mechanism which can be enabled if needed.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTLog.html">HTLog.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>History Management</H3>

Another type of logging is keeping track of which documents a user has
visited when browsing along on the Web. The Library history manager
provides a basic set of functionality to keep track of a linear
history list.
