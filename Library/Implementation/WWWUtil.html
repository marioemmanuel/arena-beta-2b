<H1>Declaration of W3C Reference Library UTILITIES</H1>

<PRE>

</PRE>

The Utility modules are mostly container modules, dynamic strings and
otherstuff that you can't live without when building applications. The
modules are used by the core part of the W3C Reference Library but can
also be used by the application. See also the main Library include
file called <A HREF="WWWLib.html">WWWLib.h</A> which contains all
converters and protocol modules known to the Library. You can include
this one if the application is to use all the functionality of the
Library.

#ifndef WWWUTIL_H
#define WWWUTIL_H
</PRE>

<H2>System dependencies</H2>

The <A HREF="tcp.html">tcp.h</A> file includes system-specific include
files and flags for I/O to network and disk. The only reason for this
file is that the Internet world is more complicated than Posix and
ANSI.

<PRE>
#include "tcp.h"

<H3>Basic Macros etc</H3>

This module includes file contains things we need everywhere,
generally macros for declarations, booleans, etc.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTUtils.html">HTUtils.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Dynamic Arrays</H3>

This module implements a flexible array of pointers. It is a general
utility module.  An array is a structure which may be extended.  These
routines create and append data to arrays, automatically reallocating
them as necessary.  It is garanteed that the last entry in an array is
<B>NULL</B>

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTArray.html">HTArray.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Association Lists</H3>

This is a small module build on top of the <A
HREF="HTList.html">HTList module</A> that provides a way to store
<EM>Name-Value</EM> pairs in an easy way.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTAssoc.html">HTAssoc.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Atoms</H3>

Atoms are strings which are given representative pointer values so
that they can be stored more efficiently, and comparisons for equality
done more efficiently. The pointer values are in fact entries into a
hash table.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTAtom.html">HTAtom.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Dynamic Strings</H3>

A Chunk is a block wise expandable array of type (char *) and is a sort of
apology for real strings in C. Chunks make it easier to handle dynamic strings
of unknown size. It is often faster than using the String Copy Routines</A>.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTChunk.html">HTChunk.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Linked Lists</H3>

This module provides the functionality for managing a generic list of
data objects. The module is implemented as a single linked list using
the scheme <EM>first in - last out (FILO)</EM>.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTList.html">HTList.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>Dymamic Memory Management</H3>

This module implements a dynamic memory API that is used throughout
the Library. The API covers three types of functionality:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#d">Handling of allocation and deallocation of dynamic memory</A>
<LI><A HREF="#r">Recovering from temporary lack of available memory</A>
<LI><A HREF="#p">Panic handling in case a new allocation fails</A>
</UL>

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTMemory.html">HTMemory.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>String Utilities</H3>

Routines for dynamic arrays of characters include string copy,
case insensitive comparison etc.

<PRE>
#include "<A HREF="HTString.html">HTString.h</A>"
</PRE>

<H3>UU encode and decode</H3>

File module provides functions functions for uuencode and decode
strings which convert a buffer of bytes to/from RFC 1113 printable
encoding format. This technique is similar to the familiar Unix
uuencode format in that it maps 6 binary bits to one ASCII character
(or more aptly, 3 binary bytes to 4 ASCII characters).  However, RFC
1113 does not use the same mapping to printable characters as
uuencode.
