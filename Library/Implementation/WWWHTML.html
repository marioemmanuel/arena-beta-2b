This is the include file for the basic HTML module that can be used
together with the core of the W3C Reference Library. It contains all
HTML specific modules which are required to compile and build the HTML
DLL.  Please note that as the HText is <B>not</B> included in this
interface. The reason is that the HText interface only is declared by
the Library but must be defined by the application. Therefore it can
not be part of a DLL but must be included directly in the
application.<P>
