This module is like the <A HREF="HTString.html">generic string utility
module</A> but it contains more Web related string utility functions.

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTWWWStr.c">HTWWWStr.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>. <P>

<H2>Next word or quoted string</H2>

This function returns a RFC822 word separated by space, comma, or
semi-colons. <CODE>pstr</CODE> points to a string containing a word
separated by white white space "," ";" or "=". The word can optionally
be quoted using <"> or "<" ">" Comments surrrounded by '(' ')' are
filtered out. On exit, <CODE>pstr</CODE> has been moved to the first
delimiter past the field THE STRING HAS BEEN MUTILATED by a 0
terminator.  The function returns a pointer to the first word or NULL
on error

<PRE>
extern char * HTNextField (char** pstr);
</PRE>

<H2>RFC1123 Date/Time Stamp String</H2>

Returns a pointer to a static area!

<PRE>
extern CONST char *HTDateTimeStr (time_t *calendar, BOOL local);
</PRE>

<H2>Date used for directory listings</H2>

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTDateDirStr (time_t * time, char * str, int len);
</PRE>

<H2>Timezone Offset</H2>

Calculates the offset from GMT in seconds. This is called from <A
HREF="HTReq.html#Library">HTLibInit()</A>.

<PRE>
extern long HTGetTimeZoneOffset (void);
</PRE>

<H2>Parse a Date/Time String</H2>

Converts a string representation in GMT to a local representation of
localtime <CODE>time_t</CODE>.

<PRE>
extern time_t HTParseTime (CONST char * str);
</PRE>


<H2>Unique Message-ID String</H2>

<PRE>
extern CONST char *HTMessageIdStr (void);
</PRE>

<H2>Converts an Integer to a String using Prefix</H2>

In computer-world 1K is 1024 bytes and 1M is 1024K -- however,
sprintf() still formats in base-10.  Therefore I output only until
999, and then start using the next unit.  This doesn't work wrong,
it's just a feature.  The conversion is done in "str" which must be
large enough to contain the result.

<PRE>
extern void HTNumToStr (unsigned long n, char *str, int len);
</PRE>

<H2>Conversion between URLs and Local File Names</H2>

These are two functions that separate the URL naming syntax from
platform dependent file naming schemes. If you are porting the code to
a new platform, you probably have to do some translation here.

<H3>Convert file URLs into a local representation</H3>

The URL has already been translated through the rules in get_physical
in HTAccess.c and all we need to do now is to map the path to a local
representation, for example if must translate '/' to the ones that
turn the wrong way ;-) Returns local file (that must be freed by
caller) if OK, else NULL.

<PRE>
extern char * HTWWWToLocal (CONST char * url, CONST char * base);
</PRE>

<H3>Convert a local file name into a URL</H3>

Generates a WWW URL name from a local file name or NULL if error.
Returns URL (that must be freed by caller) if OK, else NULL.

<PRE>
extern char * HTLocalToWWW (CONST char * local);
</PRE>
