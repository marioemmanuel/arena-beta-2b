This is the basic include files and the core include files necessary
in order to use the W3C Reference Library. It contains all core
specific modules which are required to compile and build the
Library. No converter streams or protocol modules are included in this
file as they are for the application to set up. The Library has a
special include file called <A HREF="WWWApp.html">WWWApp.h</A> which
contains all converters and protocol modules known to the Library. You
can include this one if the application is to use all the
functionality of the Library.
