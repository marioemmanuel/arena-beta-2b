<H1>Public Declaration of Request Manager</H1>

<PRE>
/*
**	(c) COPYRIGHT MIT 1995.

</PRE>

The request manager consists of two parts: a public part and a private
part. The public part contains all the information needed to define a
request the parameters to be used when requesting a resource from the
network or local file system. When a request is handled, all kinds of
things about it need to be passed along together with a request.
<P>

This module is implemented by <A HREF="HTReqMan.c">HTReqMan.c</A>, and
it is a part of the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Library/"> W3C
Reference Library</A>. <P>

<PRE>

typedef struct _HTRequest HTRequest;

</PRE>

<H2>Request a resource</H2>

This is an internal routine, which has an address AND a matching
anchor.  (The public routines are called with one OR the other.)

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTLoad (HTRequest * request, BOOL recursive);
</PRE>

<H2>Creation and Deletion Methods</H2>

The request object is intended to live as long as the request is still
active, but can be deleted as soon as it has terminatedk, for example
in one of the request termination callback functions as described in
the <A HREF="HTNet.html">Net Manager</A>. Only the anchor object stays
around after the request itself is terminated.

<H3>Create new Object</H3>

Creates a new request object with a default set of options -- in most
cases it will need some information added which can be done using the
methods in this module, but it will work as is for a simple request.

<PRE>
extern HTRequest * HTRequest_new (void);
</PRE>

<H3>Clear a Request Object</H3>

Clears all protocol specific information so that the request object
can be used for another request. It should be use with care as
application specific information is <B>not</B> re-initialized. Returns
YES if OK, else NO.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_clear (HTRequest * me);
</PRE>

<H3>Create a duplicate</H3>

Creates a new HTRequest object as a duplicate of the src request.
Returns YES if OK, else NO

<PRE>
extern HTRequest * HTRequest_dup (HTRequest * src);
</PRE>

<H4>Create a duplicate for Internal use</H4>

Creates a new HTRequest object as a duplicate of the src request.  The
difference to the HTRequest_dup function is that we don't copy the
error_stack and other information that the application keeps in its
copy of the request object. Otherwise it will be freed multiple times.
Returns YES if OK, else NO

<PRE>
extern HTRequest * HTRequest_dupInternal (HTRequest * src);
</PRE>

<H3>Delete Object</H3>

This function deletes the object and cleans up the memory.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_delete (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<H2>Bind an Anchor to a Request Object</H2>

Every request object has an anchor associated with it. The anchor
normally lives until the application terminates but a request object
only lives as long as the request is being serviced.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setAnchor (HTRequest *request, HTAnchor *anchor);
extern HTParentAnchor * HTRequest_anchor (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H2>Bind an Access to a request</H2>

This is done if you are a server. In this case you do not need an anchor

<PRE>
#if 0
extern void HTRequest_setAccess (HTRequest * request, char * access);
extern CONST char * HTRequest_access (HTRequest * request);
#endif
</PRE>

<H2>Set the Method</H2>

The Method is the operation to be executed on the requested
object. The default set if the set of operations defined by the HTTP
protocol, that is "GET", "HEAD", "PUT", "POST", "LINK", "UNLINK", and
"DELETE" but many of these can be used in other protocols as well. The
important thing is to think of the requested element as an object on
which you want to perform an operation. Then it is for the specific
protocol implementation to try and carry this operation out. However,
not all operations can be implemented (or make sense) in all
protocols. <P>

Methods are handled by the <A HREF="HTMethod.html">Method Module</A>,
and the default value is "GET".

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setMethod (HTRequest *request, HTMethod method);
extern HTMethod HTRequest_method (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H2>Update, Reload, or Refresh a Document</H2>

The Library has two concepts of caching: in memory and on file. When
loading a document, this flag can be set in order to define who can
give a response to the request. <EM>IMS</EM> means that a
"If-Modified-Since" Header is used in a HTTP request.

<PRE>
typedef enum _HTReload {
    HT_ANY_VERSION	= 0x0,		/* Use any version available */
    HT_MEM_REFRESH	= 0x1,		/* Reload from file cache or network */
    HT_CACHE_REFRESH	= 0x2,		/* Update from network with IMS */
    HT_FORCE_RELOAD	= 0x4		/* Update from network with no-cache */
} HTReload;

extern void HTRequest_setReloadMode (HTRequest *request, HTReload mode);
extern HTReload HTRequest_reloadMode (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H2>Redirections</H2>

When a redirection response is returned to the Library, for example
from a remote HTTP server, this code is passed back to the
application. The application can then decide whether a new request
should be established or not. These two methods return the redirection
information required to issue a new request, that is the new anchor
and any list of keywords associated with this anchor.

<PRE>
extern HTAnchor * HTRequest_redirection (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<H2>Max number of Retrys for a Down Load</H2>

Automatic reload can happen in two situations:

<UL>
<LI>The server sends a redirection response
<LI>The document has expired
</UL>

In order to avoid the Library going into an infinite loop, it is
necessary to keep track of the number of automatic reloads. Loops can
occur if the server has a reload to the same document or if the server
sends back a Expires header which has already expired. The default
maximum number of automatic reloads is 6.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_setMaxRetry (int newmax);
extern int  HTRequest_maxRetry (void);
extern BOOL HTRequest_retry (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H2>Retry Request After</H2>

Some services, for example HTTP, can in case they are unavailable at
the time the request is issued send back a time and date stamp to the
client telling when they are expected to back online. In case a
request results in a HT_RETRY status, the application can use any time
indicated in this field to retry the request at a later time. The
Library does not initiate any request on its own - it's for the
application to do. The time returned by this function is in calendar
time or -1 if not available.

<PRE>
extern time_t HTRequest_retryTime (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<H2>Accept Headers</H2>

The Accept family of headers is an important part of HTTP handling the
format negotiation. The Library supports both a global set of accept
headers that are used in <EM>all</EM> HTTP requests and a local set of
accept headers that are used in specific requests only. The global
ones are defined in the <A HREF="HTFormat.html">Format
Manager</A>.  <P>

Each request can have its local set of accept headers that either are
added to the global set or replaces the global set of accept
headers. Non of the headers <EM>have</EM> to be set. If the global set
is sufficient for all requests then this us perfectly fine. If the
parameter "override" is set then only local accept headers are used,
else <EM>both</EM> local and global headers are used.

<H3>Content Types</H3>

The <EM>local</EM> list of specific conversions which the format
manager can do in order to fulfill the request.  It typically points
to a list set up on initialisation time for example by <A
HREF="HTInit.html">HTInit()</A>. There is also a <A
HREF="HTFormat.html#z17"><EM>global</EM></A> list of conversions which
contains a generic set of possible conversions.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setConversion (HTRequest *request, HTList *type, BOOL override);
extern HTList * HTRequest_conversion (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H3>Content Encodings</H3>

The list of encodings acceptable in the output stream.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setEncoding (HTRequest *request, HTList *enc, BOOL override);
extern HTList * HTRequest_encoding (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H3>Content-Languages</H3>

The list of (human) language values acceptable in the response. The default
is all languages.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setLanguage (HTRequest *request, HTList *lang, BOOL override);
extern HTList * HTRequest_language (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H3>Charset</H3>

The list of charsets accepted by the application

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setCharset (HTRequest *request, HTList *charset, BOOL override);
extern HTList * HTRequest_charset (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H2>Handling Metainformation (RFC822 Headers)</H2>

The Library supports a large set of headers that can be sent along
with a request (or a response for that matter). All headers can be
either disabled or enabled using bit flags that are defined in the
following.

<H3><A NAME="gnhd">General HTTP Header Mask</A></H3>

There are a few header fields which have general applicability for
both request and response mesages, but which do not apply to the
communication parties or theentity being transferred. This mask
enables and disables these headers. If the bit is not turned on they
are not sent. All headers are optional and the default value is <EM>NO
GENERAL HEADERS</EM>

<PRE>
typedef enum _HTGnHd {
    HT_G_DATE		= 0x1,
    HT_G_FORWARDED	= 0x2,
    HT_G_MESSAGE_ID	= 0x4,
    HT_G_MIME		= 0x8,
    HT_G_CONNECTION	= 0x10,
    HT_G_NO_CACHE	= 0x20					   /* Pragma */
} HTGnHd;

#define DEFAULT_GENERAL_HEADERS		HT_G_CONNECTION

extern void HTRequest_setGnHd (HTRequest *request, HTGnHd gnhd);
extern void HTRequest_addGnHd (HTRequest *request, HTGnHd gnhd);
extern HTGnHd HTRequest_gnHd (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="rqhd">Request Headers</A></H3>

The request header fields allow the client to pass additional
information about the request (and about the client itself) to the
server. All headers are optional but the default value is all request
headers if present <EM>except</EM> <CODE>From</CODE> and
<CODE>Pragma</CODE>.

<PRE>
typedef enum _HTRqHd {
    HT_C_ACCEPT_TYPE	= 0x1,
    HT_C_ACCEPT_CHAR	= 0x2,
    HT_C_ACCEPT_ENC	= 0x4,
    HT_C_ACCEPT_LAN	= 0x8,
    HT_C_FROM		= 0x10,
    HT_C_IMS		= 0x20,
    HT_C_HOST		= 0x40,
    HT_C_REFERER	= 0x80,
    HT_C_USER_AGENT	= 0x200
} HTRqHd;

#define DEFAULT_REQUEST_HEADERS	\
	HT_C_ACCEPT_TYPE+HT_C_ACCEPT_CHAR+ \
	HT_C_ACCEPT_ENC+HT_C_ACCEPT_LAN+HT_C_REFERER+HT_C_USER_AGENT

extern void HTRequest_setRqHd (HTRequest *request, HTRqHd rqhd);
extern void HTRequest_addRqHd (HTRequest *request, HTRqHd rqhd);
extern HTRqHd HTRequest_rqHd (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="rshd">Response Headers</A></H3>

The response header fields allow the server to pass additional
information about the response (and about the server itself) to the
client. All headers are optional.

<PRE>
typedef enum _HTRsHd {
    HT_S_LOCATION   	= 0x1,
    HT_S_PROXY_AUTH 	= 0x2,
    HT_S_PUBLIC    	= 0x4,
    HT_S_RETRY_AFTER	= 0x8,
    HT_S_SERVER		= 0x10,
    HT_S_WWW_AUTH	= 0x20
} HTRsHd;

#define DEFAULT_RESPONSE_HEADERS HT_S_SERVER

extern void HTRequest_setRsHd (HTRequest * request, HTRsHd rshd);
extern void HTRequest_addRsHd (HTRequest * request, HTRsHd rshd);
extern HTRsHd HTRequest_rsHd (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="enhd">Entity Header Mask</A></H3>

The entity headers contain information about the object sent in the
HTTP transaction. See the <A HREF="HTAnchor.html">Anchor module</A>,
for the storage of entity headers. This flag defines which headers are
to be sent in a request together with an entity body. All headers are
optional but the default value is <EM>ALL ENTITY HEADERS IF
PRESENT</EM>

<PRE>
typedef enum _HTEnHd {
    HT_E_ALLOW		= 0x1,
    HT_E_CONTENT_ENCODING = 0x2,
    HT_E_CONTENT_LANGUAGE = 0x4,
    HT_E_CONTENT_LENGTH	= 0x8,
    HT_E_CTE		= 0x10,			/* Content-Transfer-Encoding */
    HT_E_CONTENT_TYPE	= 0x20,
    HT_E_DERIVED_FROM	= 0x40,
    HT_E_EXPIRES	= 0x80,
    HT_E_LAST_MODIFIED	= 0x200,
    HT_E_LINK		= 0x400,
    HT_E_TITLE		= 0x800,
    HT_E_URI		= 0x1000,
    HT_E_VERSION	= 0x2000
} HTEnHd;

#define DEFAULT_ENTITY_HEADERS		0xFFFF			      /* all */

extern void HTRequest_setEnHd (HTRequest *request, HTEnHd enhd);
extern void HTRequest_addEnHd (HTRequest *request, HTEnHd enhd);
extern HTEnHd HTRequest_enHd (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H3>Referer Field</H3>

If this parameter is set then a `Referer: &lt;parent address&gt; can
be generated in the request to the server, see <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/">Referer field in a HTTP
Request</A>

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setParent (HTRequest *request, HTParentAnchor *parent);
extern HTParentAnchor * HTRequest_parent (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H3>Sending data to the Network</H3>

The Library supports two ways of posting a data object to a remote
destination: Input comes from a socket descriptor or from memory. In
the case where you want to <EM>copy</EM> a URL, for example from local
file system <EM>or</EM> from a remote HTTP server then you must use
the <A HREF="../User/Architecture/PostWeb.html">POSTWeb
design</A>. This model operates by using at least two request objects
which gets linked to eachother as part of the POSTWeb model. However,
if you are posting from memory, we only use <EM>one</EM> request
object to perform the operation. In order to do this, the application
must register a callback function that can be called when the <A
HREF="HTTP.c">HTTP client module</A> is ready for accepting data.

be included as part of the body and/or as extra metainformation. In
the latter case you need to register a callback function of the
following type using the methods provided in the next section.

<PRE>
typedef int HTPostCallback (HTRequest * request, HTStream * target);
</PRE>

<H3>Extra Headers</H3>

Extra header information can be send along with a request using this
variable. The text is sent as is so it must be preformatted with
&lt;CRLF&gt; line terminators. This will get changed at some point so
that you can register a header together with a handler in the MIME
parser.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setGenerator (HTRequest *request, HTList *gens, BOOL override);
extern HTList * HTRequest_generator (HTRequest *request, BOOL *override);

extern void HTRequest_setParser (HTRequest *request, HTList *pars, BOOL override);
extern HTList * HTRequest_parser (HTRequest *request, BOOL *override);
</PRE>

<H2>Streams From Network to Application</H2>

<H3>Default Output Stream</H3>

The output stream is to be used to put data down to as they come in
<B>from</B> the network and back to the application. The default value
is <CODE>NULL</CODE> which means that the stream goes to the user
(display).

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setOutputStream (HTRequest *request, HTStream *output);
extern HTStream *HTRequest_outputStream (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

The desired format of the output stream. This can be used to get
unconverted data etc. from the library. If <CODE>NULL</CODE>, then <A
HREF="HTFormat.html#FormatTypes">WWW_PRESENT</A> is default value.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setOutputFormat (HTRequest *request, HTFormat format);
extern HTFormat HTRequest_outputFormat (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H3>Debug Stream</H3>

All object bodies sent from the server with status codes different
from <CODE>200 OK</CODE> will be put down this stream. This can be
used for redirecting body information in status codes different from
"200 OK" to for example a debug window. If the value is NULL (default)
then the stream is not set up.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setDebugStream (HTRequest *request, HTStream *debug);
extern HTStream *HTRequest_debugStream (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

The desired format of the error stream. This can be used to get
unconverted data etc. from the library. The default value if
<CODE>WWW_HTML</CODE> as a character based only has one WWW_PRESENT.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setDebugFormat (HTRequest *request, HTFormat format);
extern HTFormat HTRequest_debugFormat (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="context">Context Swapping</A></H2>

In multi threaded applications it is often required to keep track of
the context of a request so that when the Library returns a result of
a request, it can be put into the context it was in before the request
was first passed to the Library. This call back function allows the
application to do this.

<PRE>
typedef int HTRequestCallback (HTRequest * request, void *param);

extern void HTRequest_setCallback (HTRequest *request, HTRequestCallback *cb);
extern HTRequestCallback *HTRequest_callback (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

The callback function can be passed an arbitrary pointer (the void
part) which can describe the context of the current request
structure. If such context information is required then it can be set
using the following methods:

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setContext (HTRequest *request, void *context);
extern void *HTRequest_context (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<A NAME="proxying"><H2>Using a proxy server</H2></A>

As a HTTP request looks different when it is directed to a proxy
server than to a origin server, we need to know whether we are using a
proxy for this particular request or not. These two methods can be
used to set and check the current state whether we are going to a
proxy or not.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setProxying (HTRequest * request, BOOL proxying);
extern BOOL HTRequest_proxying (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<H2>Preemptive or Non-preemptive Access</H2>

A access scheme is defined with a default for using either preemptive
(blocking I/O) or non-premitve (non-blocking I/O). This is basically a
result of the implementation of the protocol module itself. However,
if non-blocking I/O is the default then some times it is nice to be
able to set the mode to blocking instead. For example when loading the
first document (the home page) then blocking can be used instead of
non-blocking.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setPreemptive (HTRequest *request, BOOL mode);
extern BOOL HTRequest_preemptive (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H2>Priority Management</H2>

The request can be assigned an initial priority which then gets
inherited by all HTNet objects and other requests objects created as a
result of this one. You can also assign a separate priority to an
indicidual HTNet object by using the methods in the <A
HREF="HTNet.html">Net manager</A>.

<PRE>
extern HTPriority HTRequest_priority (HTRequest * request);
extern BOOL HTRequest_setPriority (HTRequest * request, HTPriority priority);
</PRE>

<H2>Get an set the HTNet Object</H2>

If a request is actually going on the net then the <A
HREF="HTNet.html">Net MAnager</A> is contacted to handle the
request. The Net manager creates a HTNEt object and links it to the
Request object. You can get to the HTNet object using the following
functions.

<PRE>
extern HTNet * HTRequest_net (HTRequest * request);
extern BOOL HTRequest_setNet (HTRequest * request, HTNet * net);
</PRE>

<H2>Format Negotiation</H2>

When accessing the local file system, the Library is capable of
performing content negotioation as described by the HTTP
protocol. This is mainly for server applications, but some client
applications might also want to use content negotiation when accessing
the local file system. This method enables or disables content
negotiation - the default value is <EM>ON</EM>.

<PRE>
extern void HTRequest_setNegotiation (HTRequest *request, BOOL mode);
extern BOOL HTRequest_negotiation (HTRequest *request);
</PRE>

<H2>Error Manager</H2>

Errors are like almost anything kept in lists and a error list can be
associated with a request using the following functions. In order to
make life easier, there are also some easy mapping functions to the
real HTError module, so that you can add an error directly to a
request object.

<PRE>
extern HTList * HTRequest_error (HTRequest * request);
extern void HTRequest_setError	(HTRequest * request, HTList * list);
</PRE>

These are the cover functions that go directly to the <A
HREF="HTError.html">Error manager</A>

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_addError (HTRequest * 	request,
				HTSeverity	severity,
				BOOL		ignore,
				int		element,
				void *		par,
				unsigned int	length,
				char *		where);

extern BOOL HTRequest_addSystemError (HTRequest * 	request,
				      HTSeverity 	severity,
				      int		errornumber,
				      BOOL		ignore,
				      char *		syscall);
</PRE>

<H2>Bytes Read or Written in a Request</H2>

This function returns the bytes read in the current request. For a
deeper description of what the current request is, please read the
user's guide. This function can be used in for example the <A
HREF="HTAlert.html">HTAlert module</A> to give the number of bytes
read or written in a progress message.

<PRE>
extern long HTRequest_bytesRead (HTRequest * request);
extern long HTRequest_bytesWritten (HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<H2>Kill a Request</H2>

This function kills this particular request, see <A
HREF="HTNet.html">HTNet module</A> for a function that kills them all.

<PRE>
extern BOOL HTRequest_kill(HTRequest * request);
</PRE>

<PRE>
